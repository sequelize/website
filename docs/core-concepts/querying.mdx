## Joins

Joining tables is done using the `join` option. Not to be confused with [the `include` option](#differences-between-include-and-join).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="qb" label="Query Builder">

```typescript
const users = await User
  .select('user')
  .join(Post, qb => {
    qb.on('userId', col('user.id'))
  })
  .findAll();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj" label="POJO">

```typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  join: [{ 
    target: Post,
    on: {
      userId: col('user.id'),
    },
  }],
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Joins use `LEFT JOIN` by default, but can be set to another type using the `type` option.

```typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  join: [{
    target: Post,
    // highlight-next-line
    type: 'inner',
    on: {
      userId: col('user.id'),
    },
  }],
});
```

### Specifying the joined table

The `model` option can be a model class or an association. However, there are some differences between the two.

#### Using an Association

Specifying an association is the easiest way to join a table. It will automatically use the correct table name and the correct `ON` clause. 
Of course, you can always provide your own `on` clause if you want to. Your clause will replace the one generated by default.

```typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  join: [{
    // no need to specify an ON clause, it will be automatically 
    // built from the association.
    // highlight-next-line
    target: User.getAssociations().posts,
  }],
});
```

#### Using a Model class

Using a model class grants a little more flexibility. The two models don't need to be associated. You must however provide the `ON` clause yourself.

```typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  join: [{ 
    // highlight-next-line
    target: Post,
    on: {
      userId: {
        [Op.eq]: col('user.id'),
      },
    },
  }],
});
```

:::info tip

You can alias that target model using the `alias` option. This alias can be used to reference the table's attributes:

```typescript
const users = await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  join: [{
    target: Post,
    // highlight-next-line
    alias: 'post',
    on: {
      userId: col('user.id'),
    },
  }],
  where: {
    // highlight-next-line
    ['post.title']: 'foo',
  },
});
```

:::

### Differences between `include` and `join`

[`join`](#joins) and [`include`](#includes) look very similar, but they are not the same. 
You can think of `join` as the low-level API, and `include` as a high-level API - built on top of `join` - that simplifies some common use-cases.

Complex queries will often prefer to use `join` directly, while relatively straightforward ones will prefer `include`.

**Advantages of `join`**

- You have complete control over the type of join
- You can customize the join condition
- The `where` option can reference attributes from all joins.
  With `include`, [a `where` condition can only reference attributes from itself or its parent model](#filtering-associations).
- Joins can reference any table. `include` only works with tables that are associated with the main model using [Sequelize's association system](./assocs.md).

**Advantages of `include`**

- [`limit` is applied per include](#having-a-limit-per-include), whereas when using a `join` the limit will be applied to the cartesian product of all joined tables.
- Supports splitting the query in multiple queries through the [`separate`](#fetching-includes-in-separate-queries) option.
- Many-to-Many includes don't require specifying the through table join.  
  When using a join, Many-To-Many associations require 2 joins: one for the through table and one for the target table.

## Subqueries

Subqueries can go (almost) anywhere by using raw queries, in `FROM`, `JOIN`, in the list of attributes, etc…

Multiple options are available for writing subqueries:

### Using the `subquery` API

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="qb" label="Query Builder">

```typescript
import { subquery, Op, col } from '@sequelize/core';

await User
  .select()
  .where('id', Op.in, subquery(qb => {
    qb.target(User, 'u')
      .attributes(['id'])
      .distinct()
      .innerJoin(Project, 'p', qb => {
        qb.on({ 
          userId: col('u.id'),
        })
      })
      .where({
        'p.name': 'foo',
      });
  }))
  .findAll();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj" label="POJO">

```typescript
import { subquery, Op, col } from '@sequelize/core';

await User.findAll({
  where: {
    id: {
      [Op.in]: subquery({
        target: User,
        alias: 'u',
        distinct: true,
        attributes: ['id'],
        join: {
          target: Project,
          alias: 'u',
          type: 'inner',
          on: {
            userId: col('u.id'),
          },
        },
        where: {
          'p.name': 'foo',
        },
      }),
    }
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above (roughly) produces the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "user".*
FROM "users" AS "user"
WHERE "user"."id" IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT "u"."id"
  FROM "users" AS "u"
  INNER JOIN "projects" AS "p"
    ON "p"."userId" = "u"."id"
  WHERE "p"."name" = 'foo'
);
```

### Using raw SQL

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="qb" label="Query Builder">

```typescript
import { table, sql, Op } from '@sequelize/core';

await User
  .select()
  .where('id', Op.in, sql`(
    SELECT DISTINCT u.id FROM ${table(User)} u 
    INNER JOIN ${table(Project)} p 
      ON u.id = p.user_id 
    WHERE p.name = 'foo'
  )`)
  .findAll();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj" label="POJO">

```typescript
import { table, sql, Op } from '@sequelize/core';

await User.findAll({
  where: {
    id: {
      [Op.in]: sql`(
        SELECT DISTINCT u.id FROM ${table(User)} u 
        INNER JOIN ${table(Project)} p 
          ON u.id = p.user_id 
        WHERE p.name = 'foo'
      )`,
    },
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Subqueries in the `FROM` clause

The `from` option can be used to specify a subquery to use in the `FROM` clause, instead of a model's table.

Sequelize expects that subquery to return the same columns as the table it is replacing.

```typescript
import { sql, table } from '@sequelize/core';

await User.findAll({
  // Note how you have to provide your own parenthesis when using raw SQL, to give you more control over the query.
  from: sql`(SELECT * FROM ${table(User)} LIMIT 10)`,
});
```

The above (roughly) produces the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "users".*
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10
) AS "users";
```

### Subqueries in `JOIN` clauses

The above `from` clause can also be used to specify a subquery to use in a `JOIN` clause.

```typescript
import { sql } from '@sequelize/core';

await User.findAll({
  alias: 'u',
  joins: {
    target: Project,
    // This fetches 10 projects per user.
    // highlight-next-line
    from: sql`(SELECT * FROM ${table(Project)} p WHERE p.user_id = u.id LIMIT 10)`,
    type: sql`LEFT JOIN LATERAL`,
    on: true,
  },
});
```

The above (roughly) produces the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "u".*
FROM "users" AS "u"
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT * FROM projects p WHERE p.user_id = u.id LIMIT 10
) AS "projects" ON true;
```

## Includes

Includes are designed to cover the most common use cases related to fetching associations.
They are built on top of SQL [Joins](#joins) and Subqueries, but are not a replacement for them. There are use-cases that are not covered by the `include` option,
and you will need to use joins or subqueries instead or in addition to `include`.

Below are some common use-cases that are easily covered using `include`.

### Having a limit per include

The "limit" parameter only applies to its level. In the following example, the query will select a maximum of 3 users, and 
will select up to 2 projects for each of those users (for a maximum of 6 total projects):

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  // highlight-start
  // only 3 users will be returned
  limit: 3,
  // highlight-end
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    // highlight-start
    // 2 projects per user will be returned
    limit: 2,
    // highlight-end
  },
});
```

If you do not set a limit on an association, all associated entities will be included.

:::caution

It is possible to set a limit on all include levels, but be aware that the deeper a limited associated is, the more complex
the query becomes. 

The query can change drastically depending on the dialect you use.  
We recommend using the `logging` option to see what your query looks like.
If your query becomes too complex, consider using the [`separate`](#the-separate-option) option to automatically fetch that associated in a subsequent query.

:::

### Filtering associations

Each `include` can have its own `where` clause, which will be used to filter the associated entities.

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    where: {
      // highlight-start
      // Only projects named "foo" will be included
      name: 'foo',
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
});
```

:::caution

Undecided point: How should association references in WHERE behave?

The following solutions have been tagged ✅ for "technically possible" or ❌ if such a solution would be incompatible with existing options.

## ✅ Option 1: It only filters its own level, can only reference parent models

***This is possibly The "safest" solution: no broken meaning possible***

When using `include`, the `where` clause can only reference attributes from itself or its parent model.

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    // success-start
    // This is perfectly valid. "user" is a parent of "projects" 
    // and can be referenced in this level.
    where: {
      'user.name': 'bar',
    },
    // success-end
  },
  // error-start
  // This will not work. The "projects" include is a descendant of "user",
  // only parent levels can be referenced.
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
  // error-end
});
```

Note: You can still filter User based on the existence of a project named "foo"
by using a [subquery](#subqueries), or a [join](#joins) instead.

## ✅ Option 2: It only filters its own level, but can reference child includes

***it works but its behavior may not be intuitive. It may be better to simply forbid this and tell users to use join & subqueries***

The following query would only return users that have a project named "foo", but would return all projects for those users.

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: User.associations.projects,
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
  limit: 3,
});
```

It would be equivalent to the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "user".*
FROM (
  SELECT "user".* FROM "users" AS "user"
  WHERE "user"."id" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "projects"."user_id" FROM "projects" AS "projects"
    WHERE "projects"."name" = 'foo'
  )
  LIMIT 3
) "user"
LEFT JOIN "projects" AS "projects" ON "user"."id" = "projects"."user_id";
```

## ❌ Option 3: It only filters the associated model

***This solution is not possible!***

Both of the following queries would have the same behavior:

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  include: User.associations.projects,
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
});

await User.findAll({
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    where: {
      name: 'foo',
    },
  },
});
```

❌ This solution is impossible because the following query would have an impossible meaning:

```sql
await User.findAll({
  include: [User.associations.projects, User.associations.groups],
  // error-start
  where: or({
    // what would this even mean?
    // note: this is actually possible if you do a JOIN, 
    // but its meaning for include would be completely broken
    'projects.name': 'foo',
    'groups.name': 'bar',
  }),
  // error-end
});
```

## ❌ Option 4: It filters both the association AND the current level

***This is the behavior in Sequelize v6, because it is what happens when you use WHERE on joined tables, 
but it is as broken as Option 3 (for the same reasons), and should be discarded***

Take the following:

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: User.associations.projects,
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
});
```

The above will return all users that have at least one project named "foo", and only its projects named "foo" will be included.

It would produce the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "user".*
FROM "users" AS "user"
LEFT JOIN "projects" AS "projects" ON "user"."id" = "projects"."user_id"
WHERE "projects"."name" = 'foo';
```

---

A version with limits (which cannot use a simple join)

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: User.associations.projects,
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
  limit: 2,
});
```

would produce the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT "user".*
FROM (
    -- limit to 2 users that have a project named "foo"
    SELECT "user".*
    FROM "users" AS "user"
    LEFT JOIN "projects" AS "projects" ON "user"."id" = "projects"."user_id"
    WHERE "projects"."name" = 'foo'
    LIMIT 2
) AS "user"
LEFT JOIN "projects" AS "projects" ON "user"."id" = "projects"."user_id"
WHERE "projects"."name" = 'foo';
```

---

Limiting both the top level model and the association:

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: { association: User.associations.projects, limit: 7 },
  where: {
    'projects.name': 'foo',
  },
  limit: 2,
});
```

would produce this SQL:

```sql
SELECT "user".*
FROM (
    -- limit to 2 users that have a project named "foo"
    SELECT "user".*
    FROM "users" AS "user"
    LEFT JOIN "projects" AS "projects" ON "user"."id" = "projects"."user_id"
    WHERE "projects"."name" = 'foo'
    LIMIT 2
) AS "user"
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    -- limit to 7 projects named "foo" per user
    SELECT "projects".*
    FROM "projects" AS "projects"
    WHERE "projects"."user_id" = "user"."id"
    AND "projects"."name" = 'foo'
    LIMIT 7
) AS "projects" ON true;
```

❌ This solution should be discarded because the following query would have a completely broken meaning:

```sql
await User.findAll({
  include: [User.associations.projects, User.associations.groups],
  // error-start
  where: or({
    // what would this even mean?
    // note: this is actually possible if you do a JOIN, 
    // but its meaning for include would be completely broken
    'projects.name': 'foo',
    'groups.name': 'bar',
  }),
  // error-end
});
```

:::

### Filtering based on an association's existence

`include` supports the `required` option, which ensures at least one associated entity exists and matches the `WHERE` clause for returned each parent entity.
If no associated entity matches the `WHERE` clause, the parent entity will not be included in the result.

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    // highlight-start
    // Only users that have at least one project whose title is "My Title" will be returned.
    required: true,
    // highlight-end
    where: {
      // Only projects with the title "My Title" will be included.
      title: "My Title",
    },
  },
});
```

Note that in the above example, only projects with the title "My Title" will be included in the result. If you want to filter the list of users based
on the name of its projects, but still want to include all projects, you can do either of the following:

1. Use a [subquery to filter the list of users based on the name of its projects](#subqueries), and use `include` to fetch all projects for each user.
2. Use a required `include` to filter the list of users, and a non-required `include` to fetch all projects for each user.  
   This solution is easier than a subquery, but less efficient due to extra data being fetched.
   ```typescript
   await User.findAll({
     include: [{
       association: User.associations.projects,
       // If an association is included more than once, it must be aliased to avoid name collisions.
       alias: 'projects-filter',
       // highlight-start
       // Only users that have at least one project whose title is "My Title" will be returned.
       required: true,
       // highlight-end
       where: {
         title: 'My Title',
       },
     }, {
       association: User.associations.projects,
       // highlight-start
       // All projects will be included
       required: false,
       // highlight-end
     }],
   });
   ```

### Fetching includes in separate queries

Selecting many includes at once can result in both a complex query and a large amount of 
data being fetched from the database at once (due to the returned rows being the cartesian product of all included associations).

To avoid this, you can use the `separate` option to fetch the associated entities in a subsequent query.

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  limit: 3,
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    // highlight-next-line
    separate: true,
    limit: 2,
    include: {
      association: Project.associations.tasks,
      limit: 12,
    },
  },
});
```

Keep in mind that the associated entities will only be fetched after the main query has been executed.

A limitation of this approach is that you cannot reference the parent entity from the include option, since it won't be available in the subsequent query:

```typescript
await User.findAll({
  alias: 'user',
  include: {
    association: User.associations.projects,
    // highlight-next-line
    separate: true,
    include: {
      association: Project.associations.tasks,
      // This would work without the "separate" option, but won't work with it.
      // error-next-line
      where: { assignedId: col('user.id') },
    },
  },
});
```
