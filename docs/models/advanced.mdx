# Advanced model definitions

## Prevent creating a default PK attribute

By default, Sequelize automatically adds the primary key attribute `id` to every model when no primary key has been defined manually.
To prevent this you can set the [`noPrimaryKey`](pathname:///api/v7/interfaces/_sequelize_core.index.ModelOptions.html#noPrimaryKey) option to true when defining the model.

```typescript
@Table({ noPrimaryKey: true })
export class User extends Model {}
```

If you want to prevent the addition of the default primary key for every model, you can also configure this option globally:

```js
class User extends Model {}

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  define: {
    noPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  models: [User],
});
```

Instances without primary keys can still be retrieved using `Model.findOne` and `Model.findAll`.
While it's currently possible to use their instance methods (`instance.save`, `instance.update`, etc…), doing this will lead to subtle bugs,
and is planned for removal in a future update.

:::caution

If your model has no primary keys, you need to use the static equivalent of the following instance methods, and provide your own `where` parameter:

- `instance.save`: `Model.update`
- `instance.update`: `Model.update`
- `instance.reload`: `Model.findOne`
- `instance.destroy`: `Model.destroy`
- `instance.restore`: `Model.restore`
- `instance.decrement`: `Model.decrement`
- `instance.increment`: `Model.increment`

## Caveat with minification

When defining a model, the name of the model will, by default, be the name of your class.

If you minify your code, the class name — and therefore its model name — may be changed by your minifier.
This can be an issue, as many systems use your modelName, from [sequelize.models](pathname:///api/v7/classes/_sequelize_core.index.Sequelize.html#models)
to [the name of the table associated to the model](./naming-strategies.mdx).

The solution to prevent this issue is to explicitly set the `modelName` option:

```typescript
// by specifying 'modelName' explicitely, the name of this model can be safely minified.
@Table({ modelName: 'User' })
export class User extends Model {}
```
