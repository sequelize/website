# Getting Started

In this tutorial you will learn to make a simple setup of Sequelize.

## Installing

Sequelize is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sequelize/core) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/@sequelize/core)).

:::info

The following commands will install Sequelize v7.
If you're looking for Sequelize v6 (published as `sequelize` instead of `@sequelize/core`),
[visit the v6 documentation](pathname:///v6/manual/getting-started.html)

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
# This will install Sequelize 7, the latest alpha release of Sequelize
npm i @sequelize/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
# This will install v6, the latest stable release of Sequelize
yarn add sequelize

# This will install v7, the latest alpha release of Sequelize
yarn add @sequelize/core
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next you'll need to manually install the driver for your database of choice:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i pg pg-hstore # PostgreSQL
npm i mysql2 # MySQL
npm i mariadb # MariaDB
npm i sqlite3 # SQLite
npm i tedious # Microsoft SQL Server
npm i ibm_db # DB2
npm i odbc # IBM i
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add pg pg-hstore # PostgreSQL
yarn add mysql2 # MySQL
yarn add mariadb # MariaDB
yarn add sqlite3 # SQLite
yarn add tedious # Microsoft SQL Server
yarn add ibm_db # DB2
yarn add odbc # IBM i
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting to a database

To connect to the database, you must create a Sequelize instance.
This can be done by either passing the connection parameters separately to the Sequelize constructor or by passing a single connection URI:

```javascript
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';

// Option 1: Passing a connection URI
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:') // Example for sqlite
const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname') // Example for postgres

// Option 2: Passing parameters separately (sqlite)
const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite'
});

// Option 3: Passing parameters separately (other dialects)
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  // one of our supported dialects:
  // 'mysql', 'mariadb', 'postgres', 'mssql', 'sqlite', 'snowflake', 'db2' or 'ibmi'
  dialect: 'postgres'
});
```

The Sequelize constructor accepts a lot of options.
They are documented in the [API Reference](pathname:///api/v7/classes/Sequelize.html#constructor).

### Testing the connection

You can use the `.authenticate()` function to test if the connection is OK.  
Note that this is completely optional, but recommended as Sequelize fetches your Database version on the first connection.
That version is then used to determine which SQL features are available.

```js
try {
  await sequelize.authenticate();
  console.log('Connection has been established successfully.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', error);
}
```

### Closing the connection

Sequelize uses a connection pool to manage connections to the database. This means some connection can remain open even after you're done with them.  
If you wish to gracefully shut down your application, you can use [`sequelize.close()`](pathname:///api/v7/classes/Sequelize.html#close) to close all active connections.

:::caution

Once `sequelize.close()` has been called, it's impossible to open a new connection. You will need to create a new Sequelize instance to access your database again.

:::

## Terminology convention

Observe that, in the examples above, `Sequelize` refers to the library itself while the lowercase `sequelize` refers to an instance of Sequelize.
This is the recommended convention and it will be followed throughout the documentation.

## CommonJS

Our documentation makes heavy use of ECMAScript Modules (ESM), but CommonJS is fully supported by Sequelize. 
To use Sequelize in a CommonJS project, simply use `require` instead of `import`:

```js
// how you would import Sequelize in ESM
import { Sequelize, Op, Model, DataTypes } from '@sequelize/core';

// how you would import Sequelize in CommonJS
const { Sequelize, Op, Model, DataTypes } = require('@sequelize/core');
```

If you want to use ESM, head to [Node.js' documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) to learn how to use them in Node.js.

## Tip for reading the docs

You are encouraged to run code examples locally while reading the Sequelize docs. This will help you learn faster.
The easiest way to do this is using the SQLite dialect:

```ts
import { Sequelize, Op, Model, DataTypes } from '@sequelize/core';

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:");

// Code here! It works!
```

To experiment with the other dialects, which are harder to setup locally,
you can use the [Sequelize SSCCE](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-sscce) GitHub repository,
which allows you to run code on all supported dialects!

## New databases versus existing databases

If you are starting a project from scratch, and your database is still empty, Sequelize can be used since the beginning in order to automate the creation of every table in your database.

Also, if you want to use Sequelize to connect to a database that is already filled with tables and data, that works as well! Sequelize has got you covered in both cases.

## Logging

By default, Sequelize will log to console every SQL query it performs. The `options.logging` option can be used to customize this behavior, by defining the function that gets executed every time Sequelize would log something. The default value is `console.log` and when using that only the first log parameter of log function call is displayed. For example, for query logging the first parameter is the raw query and the second (hidden by default) is the Sequelize object.

Common useful values for `options.logging`:

```js
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:', {
  // Choose one of the logging options
  logging: console.log,                  // Default, displays the first parameter of the log function call
  logging: (...msg) => console.log(msg), // Displays all log function call parameters
  logging: false,                        // Disables logging
  logging: msg => logger.debug(msg),     // Use custom logger (e.g. Winston or Bunyan), displays the first parameter
  logging: logger.debug.bind(logger)     // Alternative way to use custom logger, displays all messages
});
```

## Promises and async/await

Most of the methods provided by Sequelize are asynchronous and therefore return Promises. They are all [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) , so you can use the Promise API (for example, using `then`, `catch`, `finally`) out of the box.

Of course, using `async` and `await` works normally as well.

## Next Step

Now that you have a Sequelize instance, the next step to get started is to define your models.
