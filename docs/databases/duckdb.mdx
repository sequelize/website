# Sequelize for DuckDB

To use Sequelize with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/), you need to install the `@sequelize/duckdb` dialect package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @sequelize/duckdb
```

Then use the `DuckDbDialect` class as the dialect option in the Sequelize constructor:

```ts
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';
import { DuckDbDialect } from '@sequelize/duckdb';

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: DuckDbDialect,
  database: '/path/to/local/file',
});
```

To connect to [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/docs/getting-started/), provide your database path in the `database` field:

```ts
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';
import { DuckDbDialect } from '@sequelize/duckdb';

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: DuckDbDialect,
  database: 'md:my_db',
});
```
