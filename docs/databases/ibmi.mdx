# Sequelize for DB2 for IBM i

:::danger

Our implementation of DB2 for IBM i is not integration tested against an actual database.
As such, we cannot guarantee that it will work as expected, nor its stability.

We rely on the community to help us improve this dialect.

:::

:::info Version Compatibility

See [Releases](/releases#db2-for-ibm-i-support-table) to see which versions of DB2 for IBM i are supported.

:::

To use Sequelize with DB2 for IBM i, you need to install the `@sequelize/db2-ibmi` dialect package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @sequelize/db2-ibmi
```

Then use the `IbmiDialect` class as the dialect option in the Sequelize constructor:

```ts
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';
import { IbmiDialect } from '@sequelize/db2-ibmi';

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: IbmiDialect,
  odbcConnectionString: 'DSN=MYDSN;UID=myuser;PWD=mypassword',
  connectionTimeout: 60,
});
```

## Connection Options

import ConnectionOptions from './_connection-options.md';

<ConnectionOptions />

The following options are accepted by the DB2 for IBM i dialect:
