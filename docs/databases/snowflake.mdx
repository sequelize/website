# Sequelize for Snowflake

:::danger

Our implementation of Snowflake is not integration tested against an actual database.
As such, we cannot guarantee that it will work as expected, nor its stability.

We rely on the community to help us improve this dialect.

:::

:::info Version Compatibility

See [Releases](/releases#snowflake-support-table) to see which versions of Snowflake are supported.

:::

To use Sequelize with Snowflake, you need to install the `@sequelize/snowflake` dialect package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @sequelize/snowflake
```

Then use the `SnowflakeDialect` class as the dialect option in the Sequelize constructor:

```ts
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';
import { SnowflakeDialect } from '@sequelize/snowflake';

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: SnowflakeDialect,
  accessUrl: 'https://myaccount.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com',
  role: 'myRole',
  warehouse: 'myWarehouse',
  username: 'myUserName',
  password: 'myPassword',
  database: 'myDatabaseName',
});
```


## Connection Options

import ConnectionOptions from './_connection-options.md';

<ConnectionOptions />

The following options are passed as-is to the `snowflake-sdk` package that Sequelize uses to connect to Snowflake.
Please refer to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver-options) for more information about what each of these options do.

For convenience, here is an edited copy of the documentation that only includes the options that are accepted by Sequelize:
