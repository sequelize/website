# Sequelize for SAP HANA

:::info Version Compatibility

See [Releases](/releases#sap-hana-support-table) to see which versions of SAP HANA are supported.

:::

To use Sequelize with SAP HANA, you need to install the `@sequelize/hana` dialect package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @sequelize/hana
```

Then use the `HanaDialect` class as the dialect option in the Sequelize constructor:

```ts
import { Sequelize } from '@sequelize/core';
import { HanaDialect } from '@sequelize/hana';

const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: HanaDialect,
  database: 'mydb',
  user: 'myuser',
  password: 'mypass',
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 443,
});
```

## Connection Options

import ConnectionOptions from './_connection-options.md';

<ConnectionOptions />

The following options are accepted by the SAP HANA dialect:

| Option          | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `host`          | Specifies the name of the host to connect to.                            |
| `port`          | Specifies the port number to connect to.                                 |
| `database`      | Specifies the name of the database to connect to.                        |
| `user`          | Specifies the name of an SAP HANA database user.                         |
| `password`      | Specifies the password for the SAP HANA database user.                   |
| `currentSchema` | Sets the current schema, which is used for identifiers without a schema. |

:::info

Sequelize uses the [`@sap/hana-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/hana-client) package to connect to SAP HANA.
Most of the above options are provided as-is to the `@sap/hana-client` package,
and you can find more information about them in the [@sap/hana-client documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_CLIENT/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/4fe9978ebac44f35b9369ef5a4a26f4c.html).
