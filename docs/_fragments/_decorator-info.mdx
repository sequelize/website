Sequelize currently only supports the [_legacy/experimental decorator format_](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators#how-does-this-proposal-compare-to-other-versions-of-decorators).
Support for the [_new decorator format_](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) will be added in a future release.

All decorators must be imported from `@sequelize/core/decorators-legacy`:

```ts
import { Attribute, Table } from '@sequelize/core/decorators-legacy';
```

Using legacy decorators requires to use a transpiler such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#decorators),
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators) or others to compile them to JavaScript.
Alternatively, Sequelize also supports [a legacy approach](../other-topics/legacy-model-definitions.mdx) that does not require using decorators, but this is discouraged.
