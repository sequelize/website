Closes #2571 [BUG] Allow increment/decrement operations when using schemata [BUG] Allow createTable with schema [BUG] Fix some issues with findAndCount and include [INTERNALS] Update inflection dependency to v1.5.2 [REMOVED] Remove query generation syntactic sugar provided by node-sql , as well as the dependency on that module Backwards compatibility changes When eager-loading a many-to-many association, the attributes of the through table are now accessible through an attribute named after the through model rather than the through table name singularized. i.e. Task.find({include: Worker}) where the table name for through model TaskWorker is TableTaskWorkers used to produce { Worker: { ..., TableTaskWorker: {...} } } . It now produces { Worker: { ..., TaskWorker: {...} } } . Does not affect models where table name is auto-defined by Sequelize, or where table name is model name pluralized. When using Model#find() with an order clause, the table name is prepended to the ORDER BY SQL. e.g. ORDER BY Task.id rather than ORDER BY id . The change is to avoid ambiguous column names where there are eager-loaded associations with the same column names. A side effect is that code like Task.findAll( { include: [ User ], order: [ [ 'Users.id', 'ASC' ] ] } ) will now throw an error. This should be achieved with Task.findAll( { include: [ User ], order: [ [ User, 'id', 'ASC' ] ] } ) instead. Nested HSTORE objects are no longer supported. Use DataTypes.JSON instead. In PG where: { arr: [1, 2] } where the arr column is an array will now use strict comparison ( = ) instead of the overlap operator ( && ). To obtain the old behaviour, use where: { arr: { overlap: [1, 2] }} The default fields for Instance#save (when not a new record) is now an intersection of the model attributes and the changed attributes making saves more atomic while still allowing only defined attributes. Syntactic sugar for query generation was removed. You will no longer be able to call Model.dataset() to generate raw sql queries 2.0.0-rc2 [FEATURE] Added to posibility of using a sequelize object as key in sequelize.where . Also added the option of specifying a comparator [FEATURE] Added countercache functionality to hasMany associations #2375 [FEATURE] Basic JSON support #2314 [BUG] Fixes regression bug with multiple hasMany between the same models with different join tables. Closes #2316 [BUG] Don't set autocommit in nested transactions #2418 [BUG] Improved field support 2.0.0-rc1 [BUG] Fixed an issue with foreign key object syntax for hasOne and belongsTo [FEATURE] Added field and name to the object form of foreign key definitions [FEATURE] Added support for calling Promise.done , thus explicitly ending the promise chain by calling done with no arguments. Done with a function argument still continues the promise chain, to maintain BC. [FEATURE] Added scope to hasMany association definitions, provides default values to association setters/finders #2268 [FEATURE] We now support transactions that automatically commit/rollback based on the result of the promise chain returned to the callback. [BUG] Only try to create indexes which don't already exist. Closes #2162 [FEATURE] Hooks are passed options [FEATURE] Hooks need not return a result - undefined return is interpreted as a resolved promise [FEATURE] Added find() hooks Backwards compatibility changes The fieldName property, used in associations with a foreign key object (A.hasMany(B, { foreignKey: { ... }}) , has been renamed to name to avoid confusion with field . The naming of the join table entry for N:M association getters is now singular (like includes) Signature of hooks has changed to pass options to all hooks. Any hooks previously defined like Model.beforeCreate(values) now need to be Model.beforeCreate(values, options) etc. Results returned by hooks are ignored - changes to results by hooks should be made by reference Model.destroy() signature has been changed from (where, options) to (options) , options now take a where parameter. Model.update() signature has been changed from (values, where, options) to (values, options) , options now take a where parameter. The syntax for Model.findOrBuild has changed, to be more in line with the rest of the library. Model.findOrBuild(where, defaults); becomes Model.findOrBuild({ where: where, defaults: defaults }); . v2.0.0-dev13 We are working our way to the first 2.0.0 release candidate. [FEATURE] Added to option of setting a timezone offset in the sequelize constructor ( timezone option). This timezone is used when initializing a connection (using SET TIME ZONE or equivalent), and when converting a timestamp string from the DB to a JS date with mysql (postgres stores the timezone, so for postgres we rely on what's in the DB). [FEATURE] Allow setting plural and singular name on the model ( options.name in sequelize.define ) and in associations ( options.as ) to circumvent issues with weird pluralization. [FEATURE] Added support for passing an indexes array in options to sequelize.define . #1485 . See API reference for details. [FEATURE/INTERNALS] Standardized the output from QueryInterface.showIndex . [FEATURE] Include deleted rows in find #2083 [FEATURE] Make addSingular and addPlural for n:m associations (fx addUser and addUsers now both accept an array or an instance. [BUG] Hid dottie.transform on raw queries behind a flag ( nest ) #2064 [BUG] Fixed problems with transaction parameter being removed / not passed on in associations #1789 and #1968 [BUG] Fix problem with minConnections. #2048 [BUG] Fix default scope being overwritten #2087 [BUG] Fixed updatedAt timestamp not being set in bulk create when validate = true. #1962 [INTERNALS] Replaced lingo with inflection [INTERNALS] Removed underscore.string dependency and moved a couple of helper functions from Utils._ to Utils [INTERNALS] Update dependencies validator 3.2.0 -> 3.16.1 moment 2.5.0 -> 2.7.0 generic-pool 2.0.4 -> 2.1.1 sql 0.35.0 -> 0.39.0 [INTERNALS] Use a transaction inside findOrCreate , and handle unique constraint errors if multiple calls are issues concurrently on the same transaction Backwards compatibility changes We are using a new inflection library, which should make pluralization and singularization in general more robust. However, a couple of pluralizations have changed as a result: Person is now pluralized as people instead of persons Accesors for models with underscored names are no longer camel cased automatically. For example, if you have a model with name my_model , and my_other_model.hasMany(my_model) , the getter will now be instance_of_my_model.getMy_model instead of .getMyModel . Removed support for setting sequelize.language. If your model names are not in english, use the name option provided by sequelize.name to defined singular and plural forms for your model. Model names are now used more verbatim in associations. This means that if you have a model named Task (plural T), or an association specifying { as: 'Task' } , the tasks will be returned as relatedModel.Tasks instead of relatedModel.tasks . For more information and how to mitigate this, see https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/Upgrading-to-2.0#inflection-replaces-lingo-and-changes-to-naming-conventions Removed the freezeAssociations option - use model and assocation names instead to provide the plural form yourself Removed sequelize.language option (not supported by inflection) Error handling has been refactored. Code that listens for : All Error classes properly inherit from Error and a common SequelizeBaseError base Instance Validator returns a single instance of a ValidationError which contains an errors array property. This property contains individual error items for each failed validation. ValidationError includes a get(path) method to find all broken validations for a path on an instance. To migrate existing error handling, switch from array indexing to using the get method: Old: err.validateCustom[0] New: err.get('validateCustom')[0] - The syntax for findOrCreate has changed, to be more in line with the rest of the library. Model.findOrCreate(where, defaults); becomes Model.findOrCreate({ where: where, defaults: defaults }); . v2.0.0-dev12 [FEATURE] You can now return a promise to a hook rather than use a callback [FEATURE] There is now basic support for assigning a field name to an attribute name: {type: DataTypes.STRING, field: 'full_name'} [FEATURE] It's now possible to add multiple relations to a hasMany association, modelInstance.addRelations([otherInstanceA, otherInstanceB]) [FEATURE] define() stores models in sequelize.models Object e.g. sequelize.models.MyModel [FEATURE] The set / add / has methods for associations now allow you to pass the value of a primary key, instead of a full Instance object, like so: user.addTask(15); . [FEATURE] Support for FOR UPDATE and FOR SHARE statements #1777 [FEATURE] n:m createAssocation now returns the target model instance instead of the join model instance [FEATURE] Extend the foreignKey option for associations to support a full data type definition, and not just a string [FEATURE] Extract CLI into separate projects . [FEATURE] Sqlite now inserts dates with millisecond precision [FEATURE] Sequelize.VIRTUAL datatype which provides regular attribute functionality (set, get, etc) but never persists to database. [BUG] An error is now thrown if an association would create a naming conflict between the association and the foreign key when doing eager loading. Closes #1272 [BUG] Fix logging options for sequelize.sync [BUG] find no longer applies limit: 1 if querying on a primary key, should fix a lot of subquery issues. [BUG] Transactions now use the pool so you will never go over your pool defined connection limit [BUG] Fix use of Sequelize.literal in eager loading and when renaming attributes #1916 [BUG] Use the provided name for a unique index if one is given, instead of concating the column names together #1944 [BUG] Create a composite primary key for doubled linked self reference #1891 [INTERNALS] bulkDeleteQuery was removed from the MySQL / abstract query generator, since it was never used internally. Please use deleteQuery instead. Backwards compatibility changes Sequelize now returns promises instead of its custom event emitter from most calls. This affects methods that return multiple values (like findOrCreate or findOrInitialize ). If your current callbacks do not accept the 2nd success parameter you might be seeing an array as the first param. Either use .spread() for these methods or add another argument to your callback: .success(instance) -> .success(instance, created) . .success() / .done() and any other non promise methods are now deprecated (we will keep the codebase around for a few versions though). on('sql') persists for debugging purposes. Model association calls (belongsTo/hasOne/hasMany) are no longer chainable. (this is to support being able to pass association references to include rather than model/as combinations) QueryInterface no longer emits global events. This means you can no longer do things like QueryInterface.on('showAllSchemas', function ... sequelize.showAllSchemas now returns an array of schemas, instead of an array containinig an array of schemas sequelize.transaction() now returns a promise rather than a instance of Sequelize.Transaction bulkCreate , bulkUpdate and bulkDestroy (and aliases) now take both a hooks and an individualHooks option, hooks defines whether or not to run the main hooks, and individualHooks defines whether to run hooks for each instance affected. It is no longer possible to disable pooling, disable pooling will just result in a 1/1 pool. v2.0.0-dev11 Caution: This release contains many changes and is highly experimental [PERFORMANCE] increased build performance when using include, which speeds up findAll etc. [BUG] Made it possible to use HSTORE both in attribute: HSTORE and attribute: { type: HSTORE } form. Thanks to @tomchentw #1458 [FEATURE] n:m now marks the columns of the through table as foreign keys and cascades them on delete and update by default. [FEATURE] 1:1 and 1:m marks columns as foreign keys, and sets them to cascade on update and set null on delete. If you are working with an existing DB which does not allow null values, be sure to override those options, or disable them completely by passing constraints: false to your assocation call ( M1.belongsTo(M2, { constraints: false}) ). [BUG] Removed the hard dependency on pg, allowing users to use pg.js [BUG] Fixed a bug with foreign keys pointing to attributes that were not integers. Now your primaryKey can be a string, and associations will still work. Thanks to @fixe #1544 [BUG] Fix a case where createdAt timestamp would not be set when updatedAt was disabled Thanks to @fixe #1543 [BUG] Fix a case where timestamps were not being write protected in set when underscored=true. janmeier #1523 [FEATURE/BUG] Prefetching/includes now fully support schemas [FEATURE] Centralize logging. #1566 [FEATURE/BUG] hstore values are now parsed on find/findAll. Thanks to @nunofgs #1560 [FEATURE] Read cli options from a file. Thanks to @codeinvain #1540 Backwards compatibility changes The notNull validator has been removed, use the Schema's allowNull property. All Validation errors now return a sequelize.ValidationError which inherits from Error. selectedValues has been removed for performance reasons, if you depend on this, please open an issue and we will help you work around it. foreign keys will now correctly be based on the alias of the model if you have any 1:1 relations where both sides use an alias, you'll need to set the foreign key, or they'll each use a different foreign key based on their alias. foreign keys for non-id primary keys will now be named for the foreign key, i.e. pub_name rather than pub_id if you have non-id primary keys you should go through your associations and set the foreignKey option if relying on a incorrect _id foreign key syncOnAssocation has been removed. It only worked for n:m, and having a synchronous function (hasMany) that invokes an asynchronous function (sync) without returning an emitter does not make a lot of sense. If you (implicitly) depended on this feature, sequelize.sync is your friend. If you do not want to do a full sync, use custom through models for n:m ( M1.hasMany(M2, { through: M3}) ) and sync the through model explicitly. Join tables will be no longer be paranoid (have a deletedAt timestamp added), even though other models are. All tables in select queries will now be aliased with the model names to be support schemas. This will affect people stuff like `where: {'table.attribute': value} v1.7.10 [FEATURE] ilike support for postgres #2122 [FEATURE] distinct option for count #2079 [BUG] various fixes v1.7.9 [BUG] fixes issue with custom primary keys and N:M join tables #1929 v1.7.8 [FEATURE] adds rlike support for mysql v1.7.7 [BUG] fixes issue where count/findAndCountAll would throw on empty rows #1849 v1.7.6 [BUG] fixes issue where primary key is also foreign key #1818 v1.7.5 [BUG] fixes bug with some methods relying on table information throwing strange errors #1686 v1.7.3 [BUG] fixes foreign key types for hasMany v1.7.2 [BUG] fixes transactions support for 1-to-1 association setters. v1.7.1 [BUG] fixes issue where relations would not use transactions probably in adders/setters. v1.7.0 [FEATURE] covers more advanced include cases with limiting and filtering (specifically cases where a include would be in the subquery but its child include wouldnt be, for cases where a 1:1 association had a 1:M association as a nested include) [BUG] fixes issue where connection would timeout before calling COMMIT resulting in data never reaching the database #1429 v1.7.0-rc9 [PERFORMANCE] fixes performance regression introduced in rc7 [FEATURE] include all relations for a model #1421 [BUG] N:M adder/getter with through model and custom primary keys now work v1.7.0-rc8 [BUG] fixes bug with required includes without wheres with subqueries v1.7.0-rc7 [BUG] ORDER BY statements when using includes should now be places in the appropriate sub/main query more intelligently. [BUG] using include.attributes with primary key attributes specified should no longer result in multiple primary key attributes being selected #1410 [DEPENDENCIES] all dependencies, including Validator have been updated to the latest versions. Backwards compatability changes .set() will no longer set values that are not a dynamic setter or defined in the model. This only breaks BC since .set() was introduced but restores original .updateAttributes functionality where it was possible to 'trust' user input. v1.7.0-rc6 [BUG] Encode binary strings as bytea in postgres, and fix a case where using a binary as key in an association would produce an error 1364 . Thanks to @SohumB v1.7.0-rc5 [FEATURE] sync() now correctly returns with an error when foreign key constraints reference unknown tables [BUG] sync() no longer fails with foreign key constraints references own table (toposort self-dependency error) [FEATURE] makes it possible to specify exactly what timestamp attributes you want to utilize #1334 [FEATURE] Support coffee script files in migrations. #1357 [FEATURE] include.where now supports Sequelize.and()/.or(). #1361 v1.7.0-rc4 [BUG] fixes issue with postgres sync and enums #1020 [BUG] fixes various issues with limit and includes #1322 [BUG] fixes issues with migrations/queryInterface createTable and enums [BUG] migration/queryInterface.addIndex() no longer fails on reserved keywords like 'from' [FEATURE] bulkCreate now supports a ignoreDuplicates option for MySQL, SQLite and MariaDB that will use INSERT IGNORE [BUG] fixes regression bug with 1:M self associations [FEATURE] significant performance improvements for 1:1 and single primary key includes for 500+ rows #1333 Backwards compatability changes find/findAll will now always return primary keys regardless of attributes settings. (Motivation was to fix various issues with eager loading) v1.7.0-rc3 [FEATURE] dropAllTables now takes an option parameter with skip as an option #1280 [FEATURE] implements .spread for eventemitters #1277 [BUG] fixes some of the mysql connection error bugs #1282 [Feature] Support for OR queries. [Feature] Support for HAVING queries. #1286 [FEATURE] bulkUpdate and bulkDestroy now returns affected rows. #1293 [BUG] fixes transaction memory leak issue [BUG] fixes security issue where it was possible to overwrite the id attribute when defined by sequelize (screwup - and fix - by mickhansen) v1.7.0-rc2 [BUG] fixes unixSocket connections for mariadb #1248 [BUG] fixes a hangup issue for mysql #1244 [BUG] improves handling of uncaught errors in eventemitter #1245 [BUG] fixes bug with mysql replication and pool settings #1251 [BUG] fixes bug where through models created by N:M associations would inherit hooks #1263 [FEATURE] .col()/.literal()/etc now works with findAll #1249 [BUG] now currectly handles connection timeouts as errors #1207 v2.0.0 (alpha1) [FEATURE] async validations. #580 . thanks to Interlock v1.7.0-rc1 [FEATURE] instance.createAssociationInstance functionality added #1213 [BUG] fixes a few bugs with transactions in regards to associations [FEATURE] add error handling for transaction creation [FEATURE] sequelize --undo will now actually undo migrations. Its basically an alias for sequelize --migrate --undo . #1059 [BUG] fix bug where {where: {ne: null}} would result in != NULL instead of IS NOT NULL #1231 [BUG] fixes a bug with validation skipping using the fields options. #1233 [BUG] fixes a bug with postgres and setters #1234 [BUG] fixes it so field: {type: Sequelize.ENUM(value1, value2)} works Backwards compatability changes Hooks are no longer passing value hashes. Instead, they are now passing instances of the model. Hook callbacks no longer take two arguments (previously: err, newValues ). They only take the error argument since values can be changed directly on the model instance. v1.7.0-beta8 [FEATURE] max()/min() now supports dates #1200 [FEATURE] findAndCountAll now supports the include option Backwards compatibility changes You will now need to include the relevant subtables to query on them in finders (find/findAll) Subquery logic no longer depends on where objects with keys containing '.', instead where options on the include options #1199 v1.7.0-beta7 [FEATURE] Nested eager loading / prefetching is now supported.

[REFACTORING] hasMany now uses a single SQL statement when creating and destroying associations, instead of removing each association seperately 690 . Inspired by #104 . janmeier [REFACTORING] Consistent handling of offset across dialects. Offset is now always applied, and limit is set to max table size of not limit is given #725 . janmeier [REFACTORING] Moved Jasmine to Buster and then Buster to Mocha + Chai. sdepold and durango v1.6.0 [DEPENDENCIES] upgrade mysql to alpha7. You MUST use this version or newer for DATETIMEs to work [DEPENDENCIES] upgraded most dependencies. most important: mysql was upgraded to 2.0.0-alpha-3 [DEPENDENCIES] mysql is now an optional dependency. #355 (thanks to clkao) [REFACTORING] separated tests for dialects [REFACTORING] reduced number of sql queries used for adding an element to a N:M association. #449 (thanks to innofluence/janmeier) [REFACTORING] dropped support for synchronous migrations. added third parameter which needs to get called once the migration has been finished. also this adds support for asynchronous actions in migrations. [OTHERS] code was formatted to fit the latest code style guidelines (thanks to durango) [OTHERS] Explicitly target ./docs folder for generate-docs script. #444 (thanks to carsondarling) [OTHERS] Overwrite existing daoFactoryDefinition if there already has been one.

The datatypes are used when defining a new model using Sequelize.define , like this: sequelize.define('model', { column: DataTypes.INTEGER }) When defining a model you can just as easily pass a string as type, but often using the types defined here is beneficial. For example, using DataTypes.BLOB , mean that that column will be returned as an instance of Buffer when being fetched by sequelize. Some data types have special properties that can be accessed in order to change the data type. For example, to get an unsigned integer with zerofill you can do DataTypes.INTEGER.UNSIGNED.ZEROFILL . The order you access the properties in do not matter, so DataTypes.INTEGER.ZEROFILL.UNSIGNED is fine as well. The available properties are listed under each data type. To provide a length for the data type, you can invoke it like a function: INTEGER(2) Three of the values provided here ( NOW , UUIDV1 and UUIDV4 ) are special default values, that should not be used to define types. Instead they are used as shorthands for defining default values. For example, to get a uuid field with a default value generated following v1 of the UUID standard: sequelize.define('model', { uuid: { type: DataTypes.UUID, defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV1, primaryKey: true } }) There may be times when you want to generate your own UUID conforming to some other algorithm. This is accomplised using the defaultValue property as well, but instead of specifying one of the supplied UUID types, you return a value from a function. sequelize.define('model', { uuid: { type: DataTypes.UUID, defaultValue: function() { return generateMyId() }, primaryKey: true } }) STRING() View code A variable length string. Default length 255 Available properties: BINARY CHAR() View code A fixed length string. Default length 255 Available properties: BINARY TEXT() View code An (un)limited length text column.

Use with UUIDV1 or UUIDV4 for default values. UUIDV1() View code A default unique universal identifier generated following the UUID v1 standard UUIDV4() View code A default unique universal identifier generated following the UUID v4 standard VIRTUAL() View code A virtual value that is not stored in the DB. This could for example be useful if you want to provide a default value in your model that is returned to the user but not stored in the DB. You could also use it to validate a value before permuting and storing it. Checking password length before hashing it for example: sequelize.define('user', { password_hash: DataTypes.STRING, password: { type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL, set: function (val) { this.setDataValue('password', val); // Remember to set the data value, otherwise it won't be validated this.setDataValue('password_hash', this.salt + val); }, validate: { isLongEnough: function (val) { if (val.length < 7) { throw new Error(\"Please choose a longer password\") } } } } }) In the above code the password is stored plainly in the password field so it can be validated, but is never stored in the DB. VIRTUAL also takes a return type and dependency fields as arguments If a virtual attribute is present in attributes it will automatically pull in the extra fields as well. Return type is mostly useful for setups that rely on types like GraphQL. { active: { type: new DataTypes.VIRTUAL(DataTypes.BOOLEAN, ['createdAt']), get: function() { return this.get('createdAt') > Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) } } } Aliases: NONE ENUM() View code An enumeration.

When using, GeoJSON is accepted as input and returned as output. In PostGIS, the GeoJSON is parsed using the PostGIS function ST_GeomFromGeoJSON . In MySQL it is parsed using the function GeomFromText . Therefore, one can just follow the GeoJSON spec for handling geometry objects.

You might see it referred to as both Instance and instance. You should not instantiate the Instance class directly, instead you access it using the finder and creation methods on the model. Instance instances operate with the concept of a dataValues property, which stores the actual values represented by the instance. By default, the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the Instance, that is: instance.field // is the same as instance.get('field') // is the same as instance.getDataValue('field') However, if getters and/or setters are defined for field they will be invoked, instead of returning the value from dataValues . Accessing properties directly or using get is preferred for regular use, getDataValue should only be used for custom getters. See: Sequelize#define isNewRecord -> Boolean View code Returns true if this instance has not yet been persisted to the database Model() -> Model View code Returns the Model the instance was created from. See: Model sequelize() -> Sequelize View code A reference to the sequelize instance See: Sequelize where() -> Object View code Get an object representing the query for this instance, use with options.where getDataValue(key) -> any View code Get the value of the underlying data value Params: Name Type Description key String setDataValue(key, value) View code Update the underlying data value Params: Name Type Description key String value any get([key], [options]) -> Object|any View code If no key is given, returns all values of the instance, also invoking virtual getters. If key is given and a field or virtual getter is present for the key it will call that getter - else it will return the value for key. Params: Name Type Description [key] String [options] Object [options.plain=false] Boolean If set to true, included instances will be returned as plain objects set(key, value, [options]) View code Set is used to update values on the instance (the sequelize representation of the instance that is, remember that nothing will be persisted before you actually call save ). In its most basic form set will update a value stored in the underlying dataValues object. However, if a custom setter function is defined for the key, that function will be called instead. To bypass the setter, you can pass raw: true in the options object. If set is called with an object, it will loop over the object, and call set recursively for each key, value pair. If you set raw to true, the underlying dataValues will either be set directly to the object passed, or used to extend dataValues, if dataValues already contain values. When set is called, the previous value of the field is stored and sets a changed flag(see changed ). Set can also be used to build instances for associations, if you have values for those. When using set with associations you need to make sure the property key matches the alias of the association while also making sure that the proper include options have been set (from .build() or .find()) If called with a dot.separated key on a JSON/JSONB attribute it will set the value nested and flag the entire object as changed. See: Model#find Params: Name Type Description key String | Object value any [options] Object [options.raw=false] Boolean If set to true, field and virtual setters will be ignored [options.reset=false] Boolean Clear all previously set data values Aliases: setAttributes changed([key]) -> Boolean|Array View code If changed is called with a string it will return a boolean indicating whether the value of that key in dataValues is different from the value in _previousDataValues . If changed is called without an argument, it will return an array of keys that have changed. If changed is called without an argument and no keys have changed, it will return false . Params: Name Type Description [key] String previous([key]) -> any|Array.<any> View code Returns the previous value for key from _previousDataValues .

By default, the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the Instance, that is: instance.field // is the same as instance.get('field') // is the same as instance.getDataValue('field') However, if getters and/or setters are defined for field they will be invoked, instead of returning the value from dataValues . Accessing properties directly or using get is preferred for regular use, getDataValue should only be used for custom getters.

To bypass the setter, you can pass raw: true in the options object. If set is called with an object, it will loop over the object, and call set recursively for each key, value pair. If you set raw to true, the underlying dataValues will either be set directly to the object passed, or used to extend dataValues, if dataValues already contain values. When set is called, the previous value of the field is stored and sets a changed flag(see changed ). Set can also be used to build instances for associations, if you have values for those.

Params: Name Type Description name String The name of the scope. Use defaultScope to override the default scope scope Object | Function [options] Object [options.override=false] Boolean scope(options*) -> Model View code Apply a scope created in define to the model.

Here's a couple of examples: Model.findAll() // WHERE username = 'dan' Model.findAll({ where: { age: { gt: 12 } } }) // WHERE age > 12 AND username = 'dan' To invoke scope functions you can do: Model.scope({ method: ['complexFunction' 'dan@sequelize.com', 42]}).findAll() // WHERE email like 'dan@sequelize.com%' AND access_level >= 42 Params: Name Type Description options* Array | Object | String The scope(s) to apply. Scopes can either be passed as consecutive arguments, or as an array of arguments. To apply simple scopes and scope functions with no arguments, pass them as strings. For scope function, pass an object, with a method property. The value can either be a string, if the method does not take any arguments, or an array, where the first element is the name of the method, and consecutive elements are arguments to that method. Pass null to remove all scopes, including the default. Returns: A reference to the model, with the scope(s) applied.

This is very useful for paging Model.findAndCountAll({ where: ..., limit: 12, offset: 12 }).then(function (result) { ... }) In the above example, result.rows will contain rows 13 through 24, while result.count will return the total number of rows that matched your query. When you add includes, only those which are required (either because they have a where clause, or because required is explicitly set to true on the include) will be added to the count part. Suppose you want to find all users who have a profile attached: User.findAndCountAll({ include: [ { model: Profile, required: true} ], limit 3 }); Because the include for Profile has required set it will result in an inner join, and only the users who have a profile will be counted.

However, it is not always possible to handle this case in SQLite, specifically if one transaction inserts and another tries to select before the first one has committed. In this case, an instance of sequelize.TimeoutError will be thrown instead. If a transaction is created, a savepoint will be created instead, and any unique constraint violation will be handled internally.

An update will be executed if a row which matches the supplied values on either the primary key or a unique key is found. Note that the unique index must be defined in your sequelize model and not just in the table. Otherwise you may experience a unique constraint violation, because sequelize fails to identify the row that should be updated. Implementation details: MySQL - Implemented as a single query INSERT values ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE values PostgreSQL - Implemented as a temporary function with exception handling: INSERT EXCEPTION WHEN unique_constraint UPDATE SQLite - Implemented as two queries INSERT; UPDATE . This means that the update is executed regardless of whether the row already existed or not Note that SQLite returns undefined for created, no matter if the row was created or updated. This is because SQLite always runs INSERT OR IGNORE + UPDATE, in a single query, so there is no way to know whether the row was inserted or not.

Aliases: insertOrUpdate bulkCreate(records, [options]) -> Promise.<Array.<Instance>> View code Create and insert multiple instances in bulk. The success handler is passed an array of instances, but please notice that these may not completely represent the state of the rows in the DB. This is because MySQL and SQLite do not make it easy to obtain back automatically generated IDs and other default values in a way that can be mapped to multiple records. To obtain Instances for the newly created values, you will need to query for them again.

Can be either the name of a validation provided by validator.js, a validation function provided by extending validator.js (see the DAOValidator property for more details), or a custom validation function. Custom validation functions are called with the value of the field, and can possibly take a second callback argument, to signal that they are asynchronous. If the validator is sync, it should throw in the case of a failed validation, it it is async, the callback should be called with the error text. [options] Object These options are merged with the default define options provided to the Sequelize constructor [options.defaultScope={}] Object Define the default search scope to use for this model.

If you provide a name that does not match a column, this function will act as a virtual getter, that can fetch multiple other values [options.setterMethods] Object Provide setter functions that work like those defined per column. If you provide a setter method with the same name as a column, it will be used to update the value of that column. If you provide a name that does not match a column, this function will act as a virtual setter, that can act on and set other values, but will not be persisted [options.instanceMethods] Object Provide functions that are added to each instance (DAO). If you override methods provided by sequelize, you can access the original method using this.constructor.super_.prototype , e.g. this.constructor.super_.prototype.toJSON.apply(this, arguments) [options.classMethods] Object Provide functions that are added to the model (Model).

If the part is relative, it will be resolved relatively to the calling file query(sql, [options={}]) -> Promise View code Execute a query on the DB, with the possibility to bypass all the sequelize goodness. By default, the function will return two arguments: an array of results, and a metadata object, containing number of affected rows etc. Use .spread to access the results. If you are running a type of query where you don't need the metadata, for example a SELECT query, you can pass in a query type to make sequelize format the results: sequelize.query('SELECT...').spread(function (results, metadata) { // Raw query - use spread }); sequelize.query('SELECT...', { type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT }).then(function (results) { // SELECT query - use then }) See: Model#build Params: Name Type Description sql String [options={}] Object Query options.

This can be used in search queries, both in where and order parts, and as default values in column definitions. If you want to refer to columns in your function, you should use sequelize.col , so that the columns are properly interpreted as columns and not a strings. Convert a user's username to upper case instance.updateAttributes({ username: self.sequelize.fn('upper', self.sequelize.col('username')) }) Alternatively, a condition object can be used as an argument e.g. to get the count of rows for which the predicate evaluates to true. Works on mysql and sqlite. sequelize.fn('sum', { age: { $gt: 25 }, name: 'Joe' }) An explicit cast is required on postgres. sequelize.fn('sum', sequelize.cast({ age: { $gt: 25 }, name: 'Joe' }, 'int')) See: Model#find Model#findAll Model#define Sequelize#col Params: Name Type Description fn String The function you want to call args any All further arguments will be passed as arguments to the function. An argument may be a condition object. col(col) -> Sequelize.col View code Creates a object representing a column in the DB.

[value] String | Number | Boolean An optional value to compare against. Produces a string of the form \"<json path> = '<value>'\". where(attr, [comparator='='], logic) -> Sequelize.where View code A way of specifying attr = condition. The attr can either be an object taken from Model.rawAttributes (for example Model.rawAttributes.id or Model.rawAttributes.name ). The attribute should be defined in your model definition. The attribute can also be an object from one of the sequelize utility functions ( sequelize.fn , sequelize.col etc.) For string attributes, use the regular { where: { attr: something }} syntax. If you don't want your string to be escaped, use sequelize.literal . See: Model#find Params: Name Type Description attr Object The attribute, which can be either an attribute object from Model.rawAttributes or a sequelize object, for example an instance of sequelize.fn .

The junction table is created with sourceId and targetId. Creating an association will add a foreign key constraint to the attributes. All associations use CASCADE on update and SET NULL on delete, except for n:m, which also uses CASCADE on delete. When creating associations, you can provide an alias, via the as option. This is useful if the same model is associated twice, or you want your association to be called something other than the name of the target model. As an example, consider the case where users have many pictures, one of which is their profile picture. All pictures have a userId , but in addition the user model also has a profilePictureId , to be able to easily load the user's profile picture. User.hasMany(Picture) User.belongsTo(Picture, { as: 'ProfilePicture', constraints: false }) user.getPictures() // gets you all pictures user.getProfilePicture() // gets you only the profile picture User.findAll({ where: ..., include: [ { model: Picture }, // load all pictures { model: Picture, as: 'ProfilePicture' }, // load the profile picture. Notice that the spelling must be the exact same as the one in the association ] }) To get full control over the foreign key column added by sequelize, you can use the foreignKey option. It can either be a string, that specifies the name, or and object type definition, equivalent to those passed to sequelize.define . User.hasMany(Picture, { foreignKey: 'uid' }) The foreign key column in Picture will now be called uid instead of the default userId . User.hasMany(Picture, { foreignKey: { name: 'uid', allowNull: false } }) This specifies that the uid column cannot be null. In most cases this will already be covered by the foreign key constraints, which sequelize creates automatically, but can be useful in case where the foreign keys are disabled, e.g. due to circular references (see constraints: false below). When fetching associated models, you can limit your query to only load some models. These queries are written in the same way as queries to find / findAll . To only get pictures in JPG, you can do: user.getPictures({ where: { format: 'jpg' } }) There are several ways to update and add new associations. Continuing with our example of users and pictures: user.addPicture(p) // Add a single picture user.setPictures([p1, p2]) // Associate user with ONLY these two picture, all other associations will be deleted user.addPictures([p1, p2]) // Associate user with these two pictures, but don't touch any current associations You don't have to pass in a complete object to the association functions, if your associated model has a single primary key: user.addPicture(req.query.pid) // Here pid is just an integer, representing the primary key of the picture In the example above we have specified that a user belongs to his profile picture. Conceptually, this might not make sense, but since we want to add the foreign key to the user model this is the way to do it. Note how we also specified constraints: false for profile picture. This is because we add a foreign key from user to picture (profilePictureId), and from picture to user (userId). If we were to add foreign keys to both, it would create a cyclic dependency, and sequelize would not know which table to create first, since user depends on picture, and picture depends on user. These kinds of problems are detected by sequelize before the models are synced to the database, and you will get an error along the lines of Error: Cyclic dependency found. 'users' is dependent of itself . If you encounter this, you should either disable some constraints, or rethink your associations completely. hasOne(target, [options]) View code Creates an association between this (the source) and the provided target.

User.belongsToMany(Project, { through: 'UserProjects' }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { through: 'UserProjects' }) Defining through is required. Sequelize would previously attempt to auto generate names but that would not always lead to the most logical setups. If you define a through model with custom attributes, these attributes can be set when adding / setting new associations in two ways. Consider users and projects from before with a join table that stores whether the project has been started yet: var UserProjects = sequelize.define('UserProjects', { started: Sequelize.BOOLEAN }) User.belongsToMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) jan.addProject(homework, { started: false }) // The homework project is not started yet jan.setProjects([makedinner, doshopping], { started: true}) // Both shopping and dinner has been started If you want to set several target instances, but with different attributes you have to set the attributes on the instance, using a property with the name of the through model: p1.UserProjects = { started: true } user.setProjects([p1, p2], {started: false}) // The default value is false, but p1 overrides that. Similarly, when fetching through a join table with custom attributes, these attributes will be available as an object with the name of the through model. user.getProjects().then(function (projects) { var p1 = projects[0] p1.UserProjects.started // Is this project started yet? }) Params: Name Type Description target Model [options] object [options.hooks=false] boolean Set to true to run before-/afterDestroy hooks when an associated model is deleted because of a cascade.

What we need for that are the following packages: sequelize, sequelize-cli, sqlite3. Please note, that for the sake of simplicity this tutorial will use SQLite. $ npm install --save sequelize@2.0.0-rc1 sequelize-cli sqlite3 This will install the respective packages and uses the upcoming major release of sequelize. We can now let the sequelize CLI initialize the project's directory: $ node_modules/.bin/sequelize init Running this command will create the folders config , migrations and models . Implementing a todo app As an example application we will create a very basic and simple todo tool, which allows the creation of users and the management of their tasks. bin/www In order to create a maintainable application, we will put all the database logic into the models folder. When the application gets fired up, sequelize will sync the models with the database and afterwards start the server. This way we don't clutter the application while making use of sequelize's features. $(function () { fromGithub(\"bin_www\") }) models/index.js This file has been generated with the sequelize CLI and collects all the models from the models directory and associates them if needed. $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_index\", '.js') }) models/user.js All models of our application are located as separate files in the models folder. If you want to add a new model, just add it to this folder and everything will work automagically. Also you can use the sequelize CLI's sequelize model:create . Notice that the associate method receives a parameter models , which contains every declared model within the models directory. $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_user\", '.js') }) models/task.js The other needed model is Task . It relates to the User . $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_task\", '.js') }) routes/index.js The file routes/index.js contains the logic for a request against the main homepage. It loads the models module and uses it to load all the users and tasks from the database. $(function () { fromGithub(\"routes_index\", '.js') }) This will allow us to iterate over the users in the view file. We will skip the rest of the route files for this article. views/index.jade As we passed the users to the view and include the tasks for each user, we can access the data in the view's template file. Besides listing the users and tasks, there are also forms for creating new instances. $(function () { fromGithub(\"views_index\", '.jade') }) What's next?

You will learn how to use the supported dialects, which types of database setup approaches are available, and how common scenarios can be achieved. Premise We will skip the very basic things and directly dive into the Sequelize related stuff. Here is a list of things that have to be in place before you can start: Node.JS at v0.8 or higher One of the supported databases / SQLite bindings The credentials for the respective database A basic understanding of how databases are working Optional but recommended: Coffee :) A word about promises Read about promises here . Setting up a project Now that your computer is prepared and your coffee sits next to your keyboard, we can finally get started. First things first: create a directory and initialize it with NPM! $ mkdir my-project $ cd my-project $ npm init NPM will ask you a couple of questions. Answer them or just hit the return key until it's satisfied. Once done, you can install Sequelize and the connector for your database of choice. $ npm install --save sequelize $ npm install --save pg # for postgres $ npm install --save mysql # for mysql $ npm install --save sqlite3 # for sqlite $ npm install --save mariasql # for mariasql Connecting to the database Open the created directory in your favorite text editor and add a new file called app.js with the following content: var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'username', 'password', { dialect: \"mysql\", // or 'sqlite', 'postgres', 'mariadb', 'mssql' port: 3306 // or 5432 (for postgres) }); sequelize .authenticate() .then(function(err) { console.log('Connection has been established successfully.'); }) .catch(function (err) { console.log('Unable to connect to the database:', err); }); Managing the schema of your database Sequelize supports two types of schema management. You can either define so-called migrations, which are programmatically changing your database's structure, or you can let Sequelize create the tables for you. While the first possibility of using migrations takes more time to setup, it's most likely the way to go if you want to deploy your application on many different server environments. This is because migrations are consistently changing your database according to the current state of the schema. However, the automated way of using Sequelize's function sequelize.sync will probably be a good choice on your local machine or if you just want to quickly spin up a prototype. As this article is for beginners, we will skip migrations for now and take a closer look at the automated way. Defining a model In order to let Sequelize create schemas in the database, you need to describe what kind of data you want to store. This can be done with sequelize.define : var User = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }); This will define a user model that has a username and password. Furthermore, Sequelize will automatically add the columns id , createdAt and updatedAt . createdAt and updatedAt are controlled by Sequelize - when you create a model through Sequelize, createdAt will be set, and whenever you call updateAttributes / save on a model, updatedAt will be set. Synchronizing the schema As we want to store data in the database, we need to create a representation of the model: sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function(err) { console.log('It worked!'); }, function (err) { console.log('An error occurred while creating the table:', err); }); Once executed, the database will contain a table Users (note the plural) with the columns: id - INT(11) username - VARCHAR(255) password - VARCHAR(255) createdAt - DATETIME updatedAt - DATETIME Please note, that { force: true } will drop the Users table and re-create it. Configuration You might not need the timestamps or you might not want the plural of the model's name as table name, right? Luckily there are configuration possibilities for that: var User = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { tableName: 'my_user_table', // this will define the table's name timestamps: false // this will deactivate the timestamp columns }) And just in case you want to customize the timestamp field names, you can do it like this: var User = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { updatedAt: 'last_update', createdAt: 'date_of_creation' }) Furthermore you can introduce a deletedAt timestamp so models are not actually deleted when you call destroy . Adding a deletedAt timestamp is called making the model 'paranoid': var User = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { paranoid: true }); Creating and persisting instances Sequelize allows the creation of instances in two ways. You can either build an object and save it afterwards. Or you can directly create an instance in the database: var user = User.build({ username: 'john-doe', password: generatePasswordHash('i-am-so-great') }) user.save().then(function() { /* ... */ }) This persists the instance in a two step way. If you want to do everything at once, use the following approach: User.create({ username: 'john-doe', password: generatePasswordHash('i-am-so-great') }).then(function(user) { /* ... */ }) Reading data from the database Every defined model has finder methods, with which you can read the database. Searching for a single item can be done with Model.find . Retrieval of multiple items needs the use of Model.findAll . User .find({ where: { username: 'john-doe' } }) .then(function(err, johnDoe) { if (!johnDoe) { console.log('No user with the username \"john-doe\" has been found.'); } else { console.log('Hello ' + johnDoe.username + '!'); console.log('All attributes of john:', johnDoe.get()); } }); Please note that, if no user with the name \"john-doe\" has been found, there won't be any errors. This is intended, as there are no internal or authentication errors. Defining associations A very common use case is the definition of associations between two or even more models. Once declared, Sequelize will know how to query the database to get or set associated data. Furthermore it will be able to automatically create the respective foreign key columns for you. Before taking a closer look at the code, it is critical to understand some details about the three different association types. One to one An association between one source and one target is called \"one to one\" or 1:1 association. It consists of a source that has one target and a target that belongs to a source. Sequelize expects a foreign key in the target's schema. That means that there has to be an attribute respectively a column in the target's table. var Source = sequelize.define('source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('target', {}) Source.hasOne(Target) Target.belongsTo(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // instances of Target will have a column SourceId! }); One to many An association between one source and many target is called \"one to many\" or 1:N association. It consists of a source that has many targets and some targets which belong to a source. Sequelize expects a foreign key in the target's schema. That means that there has to be an attribute respectively a column in the target's table. var Source = sequelize.define('source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('target', {}) Source.hasMany(Target) Target.belongsTo(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // instances of Target will have a column SourceId! }) Many to many An association between many sources and many targets is called \"many to many\" or N:M association. It consists of sources which have many targets and some targets which have many sources. Sequelize expects a junction table which contains a foreign key to the source table and a foreign key to the target table. A row in the table connects a source with a target. var Source = sequelize.define('source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('target', {}) Source.hasMany(Target) Target.hasMany(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // Sequelize will create a table SourcesTargets. }) Getting/Setting associations Defining associations is nice, but won't give you any advantage if you cannot read or set associations. Of course Sequelize will add respective functions to your models. Depending on the type of association you will find different methods: var Source = sequelize.define('source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('target', {}); Source.hasOne(Target); Target.belongsTo(Source); sequelize.Promise.all([ Source.create({}), Target.create({}) ]).spread(function (source, target) { // Set the association return source.setTarget(target).return(source); }).then(function(source) { // Get the association return source.getTarget(); }).then(function(_target) { console.log(_target.get({ plain: true })) /* { id: 1, createdAt: Sun Dec 08 2013 11:46:42 GMT+0100 (CET), updatedAt: Sun Dec 08 2013 11:46:42 GMT+0100 (CET), SourceId: 1 } */ }); Clearing associations Assuming we already defined the models (as in the previous code example) and synced the schema with the database, we can clear the associations like this: source.setTarget(null).then(function() { return source.getTarget(); }).then(function(target) { console.log(target); }); Adding / removing associations For 1:N and N:M associations it makes sense to not only set the associations, but also to add or remove associations. Furthermore checking for an association can be handy. var Source = sequelize.define('source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('target', {}); Source.hasMany(Target); Target.belongsTo(Source); return sequelize.Promise.all([ Source.create({}), Target.create({}); Target.create({}), ]).bind({}).spread(function (source, target1, target2) { // Set the association this.source = source; this.target1 = target1; this.target2 = target2; return source.setTargets([target1, target2]); }).then(function() { // Get the association return this.source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 2 // Remove an association return this.source.removeTarget(this.target1); }).then(function() { return source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 1 // Check for an association return this.source.hasTarget(this.target1); }).then(function(hasTarget) { console.log(hasTarget) // false // Adding an association return this.source.addTarget(this.target1); }).then(function() { return this.source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 2 return this.source.hasTarget(this.target1); }).then(function(hasTarget) { console.log(hasTarget) // true }); A combined example Now that you know the basics of Sequelize, you might want to see everything in a single program: var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'username', 'password') , User = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }); sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(function() { return User.create({ username: 'john', password: '1111' }); }).then(function(user1) { return User.find({ username: 'john' }) }).then(function(user2) { console.log(user2.get()); // Get returns a JSON representation of the user }); What's next?

It will explain how to get started with Heroku and what is necessary to setup a proper environment. We will use MySQL on the development machine and PostgreSQL on the remote servers. Getting started with Heroku Before we can roll out any software on the Heroku cluster, we need to sign up and have to connect our development environment. Here are the most basic steps: Sign up for a Heroku account. Install the Heroku Toolbelt. This tool will let you create applications and is a handy way to configure them on the command line. Use the new binary to login. Run the following command on command line: heroku login And that's it. You should now be able to do things like heroku apps . This should list all applications you've currently created on the Heroku cluster. If you've just created a new account, this should show you an empty list. You can get further information about the registration process here . A minimal express application In order to create a minimal express application, we need to install express first. We can do this via the following commands: $ mkdir example-app $ cd example-app $ npm install express $ node_modules/.bin/express . -f $ npm install $ node app.js So now we have a default express application. If you point your browser to http://localhost:8080 , you will see a tiny page welcoming you. Next step: Deploy the application to Heroku. Deployment to Heroku First of all, we need to add the right version of Node.JS and NPM to the package.json . The file should look similar to this: { \"name\": \"application-name\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"private\": true, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"node app.js\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"express\": \"3.1.1\", \"jade\": \"*\" }, \"engines\": { \"node\": \"0.8.x\", \"npm\": \"1.1.x\" } } Now we can create a Heroku application and deploy to it: $ echo \"web: node app.js\" > Procfile $ echo \"node_modules\" > .gitignore $ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m \"initial commit\" $ heroku create $ git push heroku master $ heroku ps:scale web=1 $ heroku open You should now see a browser with the same application as on your local machine. Spawning a database on Heroku In order to get a database on Heroku we can use their CLI. Just run the following command and take a closer look at it's output: $ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev This will result in something like this: Adding heroku-postgresql:dev on fast-dusk-7858... done, v5 (free) Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL Database has been created and is available ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer ! data from another database with pgbackups:restore. Use `heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql:dev` to view documentation. What we will need is the color (sounds strange right?) of the database. In this case we just created a bronze one. That means, that we will have an environment variable HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL containing the URI of the database. If you are interested in the URI, you can just run this command: $ heroku config:get HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL $ # => postgres://pfforbjhkrletg:aic5oO6Cran1g3hk6mJa5QqNZB@ec2-23-21-91-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dek11b2j1g3mfb Adding Sequelize to the application The following commands will install sequelize , the needed PostgreSQL library as well as the MySQL bindings. Also we will create a folder models , that will contain the model definitions. $ npm install --save sequelize pg mysql $ mkdir models app.js In order to create a maintainable application, we will put all the database logic into the models folder. The application's main file will then just sync the models with the database and run the server. This way we don't clutter the application. var express = require('express') , routes = require('./routes') , user = require('./routes/user') , http = require('http') , path = require('path') , db = require('./models'); var app = express(); // all environments app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views'); app.set('view engine', 'jade'); app.use(express.favicon()); app.use(express.logger('dev')); app.use(express.bodyParser()); app.use(express.methodOverride()); app.use(app.router); app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // development only if ('development' === app.get('env')) { app.use(express.errorHandler()); } app.get('/', routes.index); app.get('/users', user.list); db.sequelize.sync().then(function() { http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){ console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port')); }); }); models/index.js The idea of this file is to configure a connection to the database and to collect all model definitions. Once everything is in place we will store the stuff in a singleton. This will make it possible to load the file whenever we need database access without running into issues with duplicated database access. This file will also differ between the local machine and the Heroku server. if (!global.hasOwnProperty('db')) { var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = null if (process.env.HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL) { // the application is executed on Heroku ... use the postgres database sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL, { dialect: 'postgres', protocol: 'postgres', port: match[4], host: match[3], logging: true //false }) } else { // the application is executed on the local machine ... use mysql sequelize = new Sequelize('example-app-db', 'root', null) } global.db = { Sequelize: Sequelize, sequelize: sequelize, User: sequelize.import(__dirname + '/user') // add your other models here } /* Associations can be defined here. E.g. like this: global.db.User.hasMany(global.db.SomethingElse) */ } module.exports = global.db models/user.js All the other models of our application will be located as separate files in the models folder. We will use the import -method of Sequelize to load those files. module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"User\", { username: DataTypes.STRING }) } Running Migrations To run migrations on Heroku you must have the following entry in your config/config.json file: \"production\": { \"use_env_variable\": \"DATABASE_URL\" } Which also means you must make sure your Heroku environment has a promoted database. Then from the command line run $ heroku run bash $ sequelize -m tl;dr This article explains a straight-forward but maintainable approach for hosting an express application on Heroku.

When calling a method such as User.hasOne(Project) , we say that the User model (the model that the function is being invoked on) is the source and the Project model (the model being passed as an argument) is the target . One-To-One associations One-To-One associations are associations between exactly two models connected by a single foreign key. BelongsTo BelongsTo associations are associations where the foreign key for the one-to-one relation exists on the source model . A simple example would be a Player being part of a Team with the foreign key on the player. var Player = this.sequelize.define('player', {/* attributes */}) , Team = this.sequelize.define('team', {/* attributes */}); Player.belongsTo(Team); // Will add a teamId attribute to Player to hold the primary key value for Team Foreign keys By default the foreign key for a belongsTo relation will be generated from the target model name and the target primary key name. The default casing is camelCase however if the source model is configured with underscored: true the foreignKey will be snake_case . var User = this.sequelize.define('user', {/* attributes */}) , Company = this.sequelize.define('company', {/* attributes */}); User.belongsTo(Company); // Will add companyId to user var User = this.sequelize.define('user', {/* attributes */}, {underscored: true}) , Company = this.sequelize.define('company', { uuid: { type: Sequelize.UUID, primaryKey: true } }); User.belongsTo(Company); // Will add company_uuid to user In cases where as has been defined it will be used in place of the target model name. var User = this.sequelize.define('user', {/* attributes */}) , UserRole = this.sequelize.define('userRole', {/* attributes */}); User.belongsTo(UserRole, {as: 'role'}); // Adds roleId to user rather than userRoleId In all cases the default foreign key can be overwritten with the foreignKey option. When the foreign key option is used, Sequelize will use it as-is: var User = this.sequelize.define('user', {/* attributes */}) , Company = this.sequelize.define('company', {/* attributes */}); User.belongsTo(Company, {foreignKey: 'fk_company'}); // Adds fk_company to User Target keys The target key is the column on the target model that the foreign key column on the source model points to. By default the target key for a belongsTo relation will be the target model's primary key. To define a custom column, use the targetKey option. var User = this.sequelize.define('user', {/* attributes */}) , Company = this.sequelize.define('company', {/* attributes */}); User.belongsTo(Company, {foreignKey: 'fk_companyname', targetKey: 'name'}); // Adds fk_companyname to User HasOne HasOne associations are associations where the foreign key for the one-to-one relation exists on the target model . var User = sequelize.define('user', {/* ... */}) var Project = sequelize.define('project', {/* ... */}) // One-way associations Project.hasOne(User) /* In this example hasOne will add an attribute projectId to the User model! Furthermore, Project.prototype will gain the methods getUser and setUser according to the first parameter passed to define. If you have underscore style enabled, the added attribute will be project_id instead of projectId. The foreign key will be placed on the users table. You can also define the foreign key, e.g. if you already have an existing database and want to work on it: */ Project.hasOne(User, { foreignKey: 'initiator_id' }) /* Because Sequelize will use the model's name (first parameter of define) for the accessor methods, it is also possible to pass a special option to hasOne: */ Project.hasOne(User, { as: 'Initiator' }) // Now you will get Project#getInitiator and Project#setInitiator // Or let's define some self references var Person = sequelize.define('person', { /* ... */}) Person.hasOne(Person, {as: 'Father'}) // this will add the attribute FatherId to Person // also possible: Person.hasOne(Person, {as: 'Father', foreignKey: 'DadId'}) // this will add the attribute DadId to Person // In both cases you will be able to do: Person#setFather Person#getFather // If you need to join a table twice you can double join the same table Team.hasOne(Game, {as: 'HomeTeam', foreignKey : 'homeTeamId'}); Team.hasOne(Game, {as: 'AwayTeam', foreignKey : 'awayTeamId'}); Game.belongsTo(Team); Even though it is called a HasOne association, for most 1:1 relations you usually want the BelongsTo association since BelongsTo will add the foreignKey on the source where hasOne will add on the target. Difference between HasOne and BelongsTo In Sequelize 1:1 relationship can be set using HasOne and BelongsTo. They are suitable for different scenarios. Lets study this difference using an example. Suppose we have two tables to link Player and Team . Lets define their models. var Player = this.sequelize.define('player', {/* attributes */}) , Team = this.sequelize.define('team', {/* attributes */}); When we link two model in Sequelize we can refer them as pairs of source and target models. Like this Having Player as the source and Team as the target Player.belongsTo(Team); //Or Player.hasOne(Team); Having Team as the source and Player as the target Team.belongsTo(Player); //Or Team.hasOne(Player); HasOne and BelongsTo insert the association key in different models from each other. HasOne inserts the association key in target model whereas BelongsTo inserts the association key in the source model. Here is an example demonstrating use cases of BelongsTo and HasOne. var Player = this.sequelize.define('player', {/* attributes */}) , Coach = this.sequelize.define('coach', {/* attributes */}) , Team = this.sequelize.define('team', {/* attributes */}); Suppose our Player model has information about its team as teamId column. Information about each Team's Coach is stored in the Team model as coachId column. These both scenarios requires different kind of 1:1 relation because foreign key relation is present on different models each time. When information about association is present in source model we can use belongsTo . In this case Player is suitable for belongsTo because it has teamId column. Player.belongsTo(Team) // `teamId` will be added on Player / Source model When information about association is present in target model we can use hasOne . In this case Coach is suitable for hasOne because Team model store information about its Coach as coachId field. Coach.hasOne(Team) // `coachId` will be added on Team / Target model One-To-Many associations One-To-Many associations are connecting one source with multiple targets. The targets however are again connected to exactly one specific source. var User = sequelize.define('user', {/* ... */}) var Project = sequelize.define('project', {/* ... */}) // OK. Now things get more complicated (not really visible to the user :)). // First let's define a hasMany association Project.hasMany(User, {as: 'Workers'}) This will add the attribute projectId or project_id to User. Instances of Project will get the accessors getWorkers and setWorkers. We could just leave it the way it is and let it be a one-way association. But we want more! Let's define it the other way around by creating a many to many association in the next section: Sometimes you may need to associate records on different columns, you may use sourceKey option: var City = sequelize.define('city', { countryCode: Sequelize.STRING }); var Country = sequelize.define('country', { isoCode: Sequelize.STRING }); // Here we can connect countries and cities base on country code Country.hasMany(City, {foreignKey: 'countryCode', sourceKey: 'isoCode'}); City.belongsTo(Country, {foreignKey: 'countryCode', targetKey: 'isoCode'}); Belongs-To-Many associations Belongs-To-Many associations are used to connect sources with multiple targets. Furthermore the targets can also have connections to multiple sources. Project.belongsToMany(User, {through: 'UserProject'}); User.belongsToMany(Project, {through: 'UserProject'}); This will create a new model called UserProject with the equivalent foreign keys projectId and userId . Whether the attributes are camelcase or not depends on the two models joined by the table (in this case User and Project). Defining through is required. Sequelize would previously attempt to autogenerate names but that would not always lead to the most logical setups. This will add methods getUsers , setUsers , addUser , addUsers to Project , and getProjects , setProjects , addProject , and addProjects to User . Sometimes you may want to rename your models when using them in associations. Let's define users as workers and projects as tasks by using the alias ( as ) option. We will also manually define the foreign keys to use: User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'userId' }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { as: 'Workers', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'projectId' }) foreignKey will allow you to set source model key in the through relation. otherKey will allow you to set target model key in the through relation. User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'userId', otherKey: 'projectId'}) Of course you can also define self references with belongsToMany: Person.belongsToMany(Person, { as: 'Children', through: 'PersonChildren' }) // This will create the table PersonChildren which stores the ids of the objects. If you want additional attributes in your join table, you can define a model for the join table in sequelize, before you define the association, and then tell sequelize that it should use that model for joining, instead of creating a new one: User = sequelize.define('user', {}) Project = sequelize.define('project', {}) UserProjects = sequelize.define('userProjects', { status: DataTypes.STRING }) User.belongsToMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) To add a new project to a user and set its status, you pass an extra object to the setter, which contains the attributes for the join table user.addProject(project, { status: 'started' }) By default the code above will add projectId and userId to the UserProjects table, and remove any previously defined primary key attribute - the table will be uniquely identified by the combination of the keys of the two tables, and there is no reason to have other PK columns. To enforce a primary key on the UserProjects model you can add it manually. UserProjects = sequelize.define('userProjects', { id: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true }, status: DataTypes.STRING }) With Belongs-To-Many you can query based on through relation and select specific attributes. For example using findAll with through User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Project, through: { attributes: ['createdAt', 'startedAt', 'finishedAt'], where: {completed: true} } }] }); Scopes This section concerns association scopes. For a definition of association scopes vs. scopes on associated models, see Scopes . Association scopes allow you to place a scope (a set of default attributes for get and create ) on the association. Scopes can be placed both on the associated model (the target of the association), and on the through table for n:m relations. 1:m Assume we have tables Comment, Post and Image. A comment can be associated to either an image or a post via commentable_id and commentable - we say that Post and Image are Commentable this.Comment = this.sequelize.define('comment', { title: Sequelize.STRING, commentable: Sequelize.STRING, commentable_id: Sequelize.INTEGER }, { instanceMethods: { getItem: function() { return this['get' + this.get('commentable').substr(0, 1).toUpperCase() + this.get('commentable').substr(1)](); } } }); this.Post.hasMany(this.Comment, { foreignKey: 'commentable_id', constraints: false, scope: { commentable: 'post' } }); this.Comment.belongsTo(this.Post, { foreignKey: 'commentable_id', constraints: false, as: 'post' }); this.Image.hasMany(this.Comment, { foreignKey: 'commentable_id', constraints: false, scope: { commentable: 'image' } }); this.Comment.belongsTo(this.Image, { foreignKey: 'commentable_id', constraints: false, as: 'image' }); constraints: false, disables references constraints - since the commentable_id column references several tables, we cannot add a REFERENCES constraint to it. Note that the Image -> Comment and Post -> Comment relations define a scope, commentable: 'image' and commentable: 'post' respectively. This scope is automatically applied when using the association functions: image.getComments() SELECT * FROM comments WHERE commentable_id = 42 AND commentable = 'image'; image.createComment({ title: 'Awesome!' }) INSERT INTO comments (title, commentable_id, commentable) VALUES ('Awesome!', 42, 'image'); image.addComment(comment); UPDATE comments SET commentable_id = 42, commentable = 'image' The getItem utility function on Comment completes the picture - it simply converts the commentable string into a call to either getImage or getPost , providing an abstraction over whether a comment belongs to a post or an image. n:m Continuing with the idea of a polymorphic model, consider a tag table - an item can have multiple tags, and a tag can be related to several items. For brevity, the example only shows a Post model, but in reality Tag would be related to several other models. ItemTag = sequelize.define('item_tag', { tag_id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, unique: 'item_tag_taggable' }, taggable: { type: DataTypes.STRING, unique: 'item_tag_taggable' }, taggable_id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, unique: 'item_tag_taggable', references: null } }); Tag = sequelize.define('tag', { name: DataTypes.STRING }); Post.belongsToMany(Tag, { through: { model: ItemTag, unique: false, scope: { taggable: 'post' } }, foreignKey: 'taggable_id', constraints: false }); Tag.belongsToMany(Post, { through: { model: ItemTag, unique: false }, foreignKey: 'tag_id' }); Notice that the scoped column ( taggable ) is now on the through model ( ItemTag ). We could also define a more restrictive association, for example to get all pending tags for a post by applying a scope of both the through model ( ItemTag ) and the target model ( Tag ): Post.hasMany(Tag, { through: { model: ItemTag, unique: false, scope: { taggable: 'post' } }, scope: { status: 'pending' }, as: 'pendingTags', foreignKey: 'taggable_id', constraints: false }); Post.getPendingTags(); SELECT `tag`.* INNER JOIN `item_tags` AS `item_tag` ON `tag`.`id` = `item_tag`.`tagId` AND `item_tag`.`taggable_id` = 42 AND `item_tag`.`taggable` = 'post' WHERE (`tag`.`status` = 'pending'); constraints: false disables references constraints on the taggable_id column. Because the column is polymorphic, we cannot say that it REFERENCES a specific table. Naming strategy By default sequelize will use the model name (the name passed to sequelize.define ) to figure out the name of the model when used in associations. For example, a model named user will add the functions get/set/add User to instances of the associated model, and a property named .user in eager loading, while a model named User will add the same functions, but a property named .User (notice the upper case U) in eager loading. As we've already seen, you can alias models in associations using as . In single associations (has one and belongs to), the alias should be singular, while for many associations (has many) it should be plural. Sequelize then uses the inflection library to convert the alias to its singular form. However, this might not always work for irregular or non-english words. In this case, you can provide both the plural and the singular form of the alias: User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks' }}) // Notice that inflection has no problem singularizing tasks, this is just for illustrative purposes. If you know that a model will always use the same alias in associations, you can provide it when creating the model var Project = sequelize.define('project', attributes, { name: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks', } }) User.belongsToMany(Project); This will add the functions add/set/get Tasks to user instances. Remember, that using as to change the name of the association will also change the name of the foreign key. When using as , it is safest to also specify the foreign key. Invoice.belongsTo(Subscription) Subscription.hasMany(Invoice) Without as , this adds subscriptionId as expected. However, if you were to say Invoice.belongsTo(Subscription, { as: 'TheSubscription' }) , you will have both subscriptionId and theSubscriptionId , because sequelize is not smart enough to figure that the calls are two sides of the same relation. 'foreignKey' fixes this problem; Invoice.belongsTo(Subscription, , { as: 'TheSubscription', foreignKey: 'subscription_id' }) Subscription.hasMany(Invoice, { foreignKey: 'subscription_id' ) Associating objects Because Sequelize is doing a lot of magic, you have to call Sequelize.sync after setting the associations! Doing so will allow you the following: Project.belongsToMany(Task) Task.belongsToMany(Project) Project.create()... Task.create()... Task.create()... // save them... and then: project.setTasks([task1, task2]).then(function() { // saved! }) // ok, now they are saved... how do I get them later on? project.getTasks().then(function(associatedTasks) { // associatedTasks is an array of tasks }) // You can also pass filters to the getter method. // They are equal to the options you can pass to a usual finder method. project.getTasks({ where: 'id > 10' }).then(function(tasks) { // tasks with an id greater than 10 :) }) // You can also only retrieve certain fields of a associated object. project.getTasks({attributes: ['title']}).then(function(tasks) { // retrieve tasks with the attributes \"title\" and \"id\" }) To remove created associations you can just call the set method without a specific id: // remove the association with task1 project.setTasks([task2]).then(function(associatedTasks) { // you will get task2 only }) // remove 'em all project.setTasks([]).then(function(associatedTasks) { // you will get an empty array }) // or remove 'em more directly project.removeTask(task1).then(function() { // it's gone }) // and add 'em again project.addTask(task1).then(function() { // it's back again }) You can of course also do it vice versa: // project is associated with task1 and task2 task2.setProject(null).then(function() { // and it's gone }) For hasOne/belongsTo its basically the same: Task.hasOne(User, {as: \"Author\"}) Task#setAuthor(anAuthor) Adding associations to a relation with a custom join table can be done in two ways (continuing with the associations defined in the previous chapter): // Either by adding a property with the name of the join table model to the object, before creating the association project.UserProjects = { status: 'active' } u.addProject(project) // Or by providing a second argument when adding the association, containing the data that should go in the join table u.addProject(project, { status: 'active' }) // When associating multiple objects, you can combine the two options above. In this case the second argument // will be treated as a defaults object, that will be used if no data is provided project1.UserProjects = { status: 'inactive' } u.setProjects([project1, project2], { status: 'active' }) // The code above will record inactive for project one, and active for project two in the join table When getting data on an association that has a custom join table, the data from the join table will be returned as a DAO instance: u.getProjects().then(function(projects) { var project = projects[0] if (project.UserProjects.status === 'active') { // .. do magic // since this is a real DAO instance, you can save it directly after you are done doing magic return project.UserProjects.save() } }) If you only need some of the attributes from the join table, you can provide an array with the attributes you want: // This will select only name from the Projects table, and only status from the UserProjects table user.getProjects({ attributes: ['name'], joinTableAttributes: ['status']}) Check associations You can also check if an object is already associated with another one (N:M only). Here is how you'd do it: // check if an object is one of associated ones: Project.create({ /* */ }).then(function(project) { return User.create({ /* */ }).then(function(user) { return project.hasUser(user).then(function(result) { // result would be false return project.addUser(user).then(function() { return project.hasUser(user).then(function(result) { // result would be true }) }) }) }) }) // check if all associated objects are as expected: // let's assume we have already a project and two users project.setUsers([user1, user2]).then(function() { return project.hasUsers([user1]); }).then(function(result) { // result would be false return project.hasUsers([user1, user2]); }).then(function(result) { // result would be true }) Foreign Keys When you create associations between your models in sequelize, foreign key references with constraints will automatically be created. The setup below: var Task = this.sequelize.define('task', { title: Sequelize.STRING }) , User = this.sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING }) User.hasMany(Task) Task.belongsTo(User) Will generate the following SQL: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `User` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `username` VARCHAR(255) ); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Task` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `title` VARCHAR(255), `user_id` INTEGER REFERENCES `User` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE ); The relation between task and user injects the user_id foreign key on tasks, and marks it as a reference to the User table. By default user_id will be set to NULL if the referenced user is deleted, and updated if the id of the user id updated. These options can be overridden by passing onUpdate and onDelete options to the association calls. The validation options are RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT, SET NULL . For 1:1 and 1:m associations the default option is SET NULL for deletion, and CASCADE for updates. For n:m, the default for both is CASCADE . This means, that if you delete or update a row from one side of an n:m association, all the rows in the join table referencing that row will also be deleted or updated. Adding constraints between tables means that tables must be created in the database in a certain order, when using sequelize.sync . If Task has a reference to User, the User table must be created before the Task table can be created. This can sometimes lead to circular references, where sequelize cannot find an order in which to sync. Imagine a scenario of documents and versions. A document can have multiple versions, and for convenience, a document has an reference to it's current version. var Document = this.sequelize.define('document', { author: Sequelize.STRING }) , Version = this.sequelize.define('version', { timestamp: Sequelize.DATE }) Document.hasMany(Version) // This adds document_id to version Document.belongsTo(Version, { as: 'Current', foreignKey: 'current_version_id'}) // This adds current_version_id to document However, the code above will result in the following error: Cyclic dependency found. 'Document' is dependent of itself. Dependency Chain: Document -> Version => Document . In order to alleviate that, we can pass constraints: false to one of the associations: Document.hasMany(Version) Document.belongsTo(Version, { as: 'Current', foreignKey: 'current_version_id', constraints: false}) Which will allow us to sync the tables correctly: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Document` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `author` VARCHAR(255), `current_version_id` INTEGER ); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Version` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `timestamp` DATETIME, `document_id` INTEGER REFERENCES `Document` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE ); Enforcing a foreign key reference without constraints Some times you may want to reference another table, without adding any constraints, or associations.

Whether the attributes are camelcase or not depends on the two models joined by the table (in this case User and Project). Defining through is required. Sequelize would previously attempt to autogenerate names but that would not always lead to the most logical setups. This will add methods getUsers , setUsers , addUser , addUsers to Project , and getProjects , setProjects , addProject , and addProjects to User . Sometimes you may want to rename your models when using them in associations. Let's define users as workers and projects as tasks by using the alias ( as ) option. We will also manually define the foreign keys to use: User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'userId' }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { as: 'Workers', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'projectId' }) foreignKey will allow you to set source model key in the through relation. otherKey will allow you to set target model key in the through relation. User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks', foreignKey: 'userId', otherKey: 'projectId'}) Of course you can also define self references with belongsToMany: Person.belongsToMany(Person, { as: 'Children', through: 'PersonChildren' }) // This will create the table PersonChildren which stores the ids of the objects. If you want additional attributes in your join table, you can define a model for the join table in sequelize, before you define the association, and then tell sequelize that it should use that model for joining, instead of creating a new one: User = sequelize.define('user', {}) Project = sequelize.define('project', {}) UserProjects = sequelize.define('userProjects', { status: DataTypes.STRING }) User.belongsToMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.belongsToMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) To add a new project to a user and set its status, you pass an extra object to the setter, which contains the attributes for the join table user.addProject(project, { status: 'started' }) By default the code above will add projectId and userId to the UserProjects table, and remove any previously defined primary key attribute - the table will be uniquely identified by the combination of the keys of the two tables, and there is no reason to have other PK columns. To enforce a primary key on the UserProjects model you can add it manually.

For example, a model named user will add the functions get/set/add User to instances of the associated model, and a property named .user in eager loading, while a model named User will add the same functions, but a property named .User (notice the upper case U) in eager loading. As we've already seen, you can alias models in associations using as . In single associations (has one and belongs to), the alias should be singular, while for many associations (has many) it should be plural. Sequelize then uses the inflection library to convert the alias to its singular form. However, this might not always work for irregular or non-english words. In this case, you can provide both the plural and the singular form of the alias: User.belongsToMany(Project, { as: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks' }}) // Notice that inflection has no problem singularizing tasks, this is just for illustrative purposes. If you know that a model will always use the same alias in associations, you can provide it when creating the model var Project = sequelize.define('project', attributes, { name: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks', } }) User.belongsToMany(Project); This will add the functions add/set/get Tasks to user instances. Remember, that using as to change the name of the association will also change the name of the foreign key. When using as , it is safest to also specify the foreign key. Invoice.belongsTo(Subscription) Subscription.hasMany(Invoice) Without as , this adds subscriptionId as expected. However, if you were to say Invoice.belongsTo(Subscription, { as: 'TheSubscription' }) , you will have both subscriptionId and theSubscriptionId , because sequelize is not smart enough to figure that the calls are two sides of the same relation.

By default user_id will be set to NULL if the referenced user is deleted, and updated if the id of the user id updated. These options can be overridden by passing onUpdate and onDelete options to the association calls. The validation options are RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT, SET NULL . For 1:1 and 1:m associations the default option is SET NULL for deletion, and CASCADE for updates. For n:m, the default for both is CASCADE . This means, that if you delete or update a row from one side of an n:m association, all the rows in the join table referencing that row will also be deleted or updated. Adding constraints between tables means that tables must be created in the database in a certain order, when using sequelize.sync . If Task has a reference to User, the User table must be created before the Task table can be created.

For example, if you want to always set a value on a model before saving it, you can add a beforeUpdate hook. For a full list of hooks, see Hooks API . Order of Operations (1) beforeBulkCreate(instances, options, fn) beforeBulkDestroy(options, fn) beforeBulkUpdate(options, fn) (2) beforeValidate(instance, options, fn) (-) validate (3) afterValidate(instance, options, fn) - or - validationFailed(instance, options, error, fn) (4) beforeCreate(instance, options, fn) beforeDestroy(instance, options, fn) beforeUpdate(instance, options, fn) (-) create destroy update (5) afterCreate(instance, options, fn) afterDestroy(instance, options, fn) afterUpdate(instance, options, fn) (6) afterBulkCreate(instances, options, fn) afterBulkDestroy(options, fn) afterBulkUpdate(options, fn) Declaring Hooks Arguments to hooks are passed by reference. This means, that you can change the values, and this will be reflected in the insert / update statement. A hook may contain async actions - in this case the hook function should return a promise. There are currently three ways to programmatically add hooks: // Method 1 via the .define() method var User = sequelize.define('user', { username: DataTypes.STRING, mood: { type: DataTypes.ENUM, values: ['happy', 'sad', 'neutral'] } }, { hooks: { beforeValidate: function(user, options) { user.mood = 'happy' }, afterValidate: function(user, options) { user.username = 'Toni' } } }) // Method 2 via the .hook() method User.hook('beforeValidate', function(user, options) { user.mood = 'happy' }) User.hook('afterValidate', function(user, options) { return sequelize.Promise.reject(\"I'm afraid I can't let you do that!\") }) // Method 3 via the direct method User.beforeCreate(function(user, options) { return hashPassword(user.password).then(function (hashedPw) { user.password = hashedPw; }); }) User.afterValidate('myHookAfter', function(user, options, fn) { user.username = 'Toni' }) Removing hooks Only a hook with name param can be removed. var Book = sequelize.define('book', { title: DataTypes.STRING }) Book.addHook('afterCreate', 'notifyUsers', function(book, options) { // ... }) Book.removeHook('afterCreate', 'notifyUsers') Global / universal hooks Global hooks are hooks which are run for all models. They can define behaviours that you want for all your models, and are especially useful for plugins. They can be defined in two ways, which have slightly different semantics: Sequelize.options.define (default hook) var sequelize = new Sequelize(..., { define: { hooks: { beforeCreate: function () { // Do stuff } } } }); This adds a default hook to all models, which is run if the model does not define its own beforeCreate hook: var User = sequelize.define('user'); var Project = sequelize.define('project', {}, { hooks: { beforeCreate: function () { // Do other stuff } } }); User.create() // Runs the global hook Project.create() // Runs its own hook (because the global hook is overwritten) Sequelize.addHook (permanent hook) sequelize.addHook('beforeCreate', function () { // Do stuff }); This hooks is always run before create, regardless of whether the model specifies its own beforeCreate hook: var User = sequelize.define('user'); var Project = sequelize.define('project', {}, { hooks: { beforeCreate: function () { // Do other stuff } } }); User.create() // Runs the global hook Project.create() // Runs its own hook, followed by the global hook Local hooks are always run before global hooks. Instance hooks The following hooks will emit whenever you're editing a single object beforeValidate afterValidate or validationFailed beforeCreate / beforeUpdate / beforeDestroy afterCreate / afterUpdate / afterDestroy // ...define ... User.beforeCreate(function(user) { if (user.accessLevel > 10 && user.username !== \"Boss\") { throw new Error(\"You can't grant this user an access level above 10!\") } }) This example will return an error: User.create({username: 'Not a Boss', accessLevel: 20}).catch(function(err) { console.log(err) // You can't grant this user an access level above 10! }) The following example would return successful: User.create({username: 'Boss', accessLevel: 20}).then(function(user) { console.log(user) // user object with username as Boss and accessLevel of 20 }) Model hooks Sometimes you'll be editing more than one record at a time by utilizing the bulkCreate, update, destroy methods on the model. The following will emit whenever you're using one of those methods. beforeBulkCreate / beforeBulkUpdate / beforeBulkDestroy afterBulkCreate / afterBulkUpdate / afterBulkDestroy If you want to emit hooks for each individual record, along with the bulk hooks you can pass individualHooks: true to the call. Model.destroy({ where: {accessLevel: 0}, individualHooks: true}) // Will select all records that are about to be deleted and emit before- + after- Destroy on each instance Model.update({username: 'Toni'}, { where: {accessLevel: 0}, individualHooks: true}) // Will select all records that are about to be updated and emit before- + after- Update on each instance Some model hooks have two or three parameters sent to each hook depending on it's type. Model.beforeBulkCreate(function(records, fields) { // records = the first argument sent to .bulkCreate // fields = the second argument sent to .bulkCreate }) Model.bulkCreate([ {username: 'Toni'}, // part of records argument {username: 'Tobi'} // part of records argument ], ['username'] /* part of fields argument */) Model.beforeBulkUpdate(function(attributes, where) { // attributes = first argument sent to Model.update // where = second argument sent to Model.update }) Model.update({gender: 'Male'} /*attributes argument*/, { where: {username: 'Tom'}} /*where argument*/) Model.beforeBulkDestroy(function(whereClause) { // whereClause = first argument sent to Model.destroy }) Model.destroy({ where: {username: 'Tom'}} /*whereClause argument*/) If you use Model.bulkCreate(...) with the updatesOnDuplicate option, changes made in the hook to fields that aren't given in the updatesOnDuplicate array will not be persisted to the database. However it is possible to change the updatesOnDuplicate option inside the hook if this is what you want. // Bulk updating existing users with updatesOnDuplicate option Users.bulkCreate([{ id: 1, isMemeber: true}, { id: 2, isMember: false}], { updatesOnDuplicate: ['isMember']}) User.beforeBulkCreate(function (users, options) { users.forEach(function (user) { if (user.isMember) { user.memberSince = new Date() } }) // Add memberSince to updatesOnDuplicate otherwise the memberSince date wont be // saved to the database options.updatesOnDuplicate.push('memberSince') }) Associations For the most part hooks will work the same for instances when being associated except a few things When using add/set functions the beforeUpdate/afterUpdate hooks will run. The only way to call beforeDestroy/afterDestroy hooks are on associations with onDelete: 'cascade' and the option hooks: true . For instance: var Projects = sequelize.define('projects', { title: DataTypes.STRING }) var Tasks = sequelize.define('tasks', { title: DataTypes.STRING }) Projects.hasMany(Tasks, { onDelete: 'cascade', hooks: true }) Tasks.belongsTo(Projects) This code will run beforeDestroy/afterDestroy on the Tasks table. Sequelize, by default, will try to optimize your queries as much as possible. When calling cascade on delete, Sequelize will simply execute a DELETE FROM `table` WHERE associatedIdentifier = associatedIdentifier.primaryKey However, adding hooks: true explicitly tells Sequelize that optimization is not of your concern and will perform a SELECT on the associated objects and destroy each instance one by one in order to be able to call the hooks with the right parameters. If your association is of type n:m , you may be interested in firing hooks on the through model when using the remove call. Internally, sequelize is using Model.destroy resulting in calling the bulkDestroy instead of the before/afterDestroy hooks on each through instance. This can be simply solved by passing {individualHooks: true} to the remove call, resulting on each hook to be called on each removed through instance object. A Note About Transactions Note that many model operations in Sequelize allow you to specify a transaction in the options parameter of the method. If a transaction is specified in the original call, it will be present in the options parameter passed to the hook function. For example, consider the following snippet: // Here we use the promise-style of async hooks rather than // the callback. User.hook('afterCreate', function(user, options) { // 'transaction' will be available in options.transaction // This operation will be part of the same transaction as the // original User.create call. return User.update({ mood: 'sad' }, { where: { id: user.id }, transaction: options.transaction }); }); sequelize.transaction(function(t) { User.create({ username: 'someguy', mood: 'happy', transaction: t }); }); If we had not included the transaction option in our call to User.update in the preceding code, no change would have occurred, since our newly created user does not exist in the database until the pending transaction has been committed. Internal Transactions It is very important to recognize that sequelize may make use of transactions internally for certain operations such as Model.findOrCreate . If your hook functions execute read or write operations that rely on the object's presence in the database, or modify the object's stored values like the example in the preceding section, you should always specify { transaction: options.transaction } . If the hook has been called in the process of a transacted operation, this makes sure that your dependent read/write is a part of that same transaction. If the hook is not transacted, you have simply specified { transaction: null } and can expect the default behaviour.","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"docs/hooks/#order-of-operations","text":"(1) beforeBulkCreate(instances, options, fn) beforeBulkDestroy(options, fn) beforeBulkUpdate(options, fn) (2) beforeValidate(instance, options, fn) (-) validate (3) afterValidate(instance, options, fn) - or - validationFailed(instance, options, error, fn) (4) beforeCreate(instance, options, fn) beforeDestroy(instance, options, fn) beforeUpdate(instance, options, fn) (-) create destroy update (5) afterCreate(instance, options, fn) afterDestroy(instance, options, fn) afterUpdate(instance, options, fn) (6) afterBulkCreate(instances, options, fn) afterBulkDestroy(options, fn) afterBulkUpdate(options, fn)","title":"Order of Operations"},{"location":"docs/hooks/#declaring-hooks","text":"Arguments to hooks are passed by reference.

You might recognize the syntax if you coded Ruby in the past. Using the build -method will return an unsaved object, which you explicitly have to save. var project = Project.build({ title: 'my awesome project', description: 'woot woot. this will make me a rich man' }) var task = Task.build({ title: 'specify the project idea', description: 'bla', deadline: new Date() }) Built instances will automatically get default values when they were defined: // first define the model var Task = sequelize.define('task', { title: Sequelize.STRING, rating: { type: Sequelize.STRING, defaultValue: 3 } }) // now instantiate an object var task = Task.build({title: 'very important task'}) task.title // ==> 'very important task' task.rating // ==> 3 To get it stored in the database, use the save -method and catch the events ... if needed: project.save().then(function() { // my nice callback stuff }) task.save().catch(function(error) { // mhhh, wth! }) // you can also build, save and access the object with chaining: Task .build({ title: 'foo', description: 'bar', deadline: new Date() }) .save() .then(function(anotherTask) { // you can now access the currently saved task with the variable anotherTask... nice! }).catch(function(error) { // Ooops, do some error-handling }) Creating persistent instances Besides constructing objects, that needs an explicit save call to get stored in the database, there is also the possibility to do all those steps with one single command. It's called create . Task.create({ title: 'foo', description: 'bar', deadline: new Date() }).then(function(task) { // you can now access the newly created task via the variable task }) It is also possible to define which attributes can be set via the create method. This can be especially very handy if you create database entries based on a form which can be filled by a user. Using that would for example allow you to restrict the User model to set only a username and an address but not an admin flag: User.create({ username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, { fields: [ 'username' ] }).then(function(user) { // let's assume the default of isAdmin is false: console.log(user.get({ plain: true })) // => { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: false } }) Updating / Saving / Persisting an instance Now lets change some values and save changes to the database... There are two ways to do that: // way 1 task.title = 'a very different title now' task.save().then(function() {}) // way 2 task.update({ title: 'a very different title now' }).then(function() {}) It's also possible to define which attributes should be saved when calling save , by passing an array of column names. This is useful when you set attributes based on a previously defined object. E.g. if you get the values of an object via a form of a web app. Furthermore this is used internally for update . This is how it looks like: task.title = 'foooo' task.description = 'baaaaaar' task.save({fields: ['title']}).then(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) // The equivalent call using update looks like this: task.update({ title: 'foooo', description: 'baaaaaar'}, {fields: ['title']}).then(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) When you call save without changing any attribute, this method will execute nothing; Destroying / Deleting persistent instances Once you created an object and got a reference to it, you can delete it from the database. The relevant method is destroy : Task.create({ title: 'a task' }).then(function(task) { // now you see me... return task.destroy(); }).then(function() { // now i'm gone :) }) If the paranoid options is true, the object will not be deleted, instead the deletedAt column will be set to the current timestamp. To force the deletion, you can pass force: true to the destroy call: task.destroy({ force: true }) Working in bulk (creating, updating and destroying multiple rows at once) In addition to updating a single instance, you can also create, update, and delete multiple instances at once. The functions you are looking for are called Model.bulkCreate Model.update Model.destroy Since you are working with multiple models, the callbacks will not return DAO instances. BulkCreate will return an array of model instances/DAOs, they will however, unlike create , not have the resulting values of autoIncrement attributes. update and destroy will return the number of affected rows. First lets look at bulkCreate User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'foo', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'bar', isAdmin: false } ]).then(function() { // Notice: There are no arguments here, as of right now you'll have to... return User.findAll(); }).then(function(users) { console.log(users) // ... in order to get the array of user objects }) To update several rows at once: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).then(function() { return Task.update( { status: 'inactive' }, /* set attributes' value */, { where: { subject: 'programming' }} /* where criteria */ ); }).spread(function(affectedCount, affectedRows) { // .update returns two values in an array, therefore we use .spread // Notice that affectedRows will only be defined in dialects which support returning: true // affectedCount will be 2 return Task.findAll(); }).then(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // the 'programming' tasks will both have a status of 'inactive' }) And delete them: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).then(function() { return Task.destroy({ where: { subject: 'programming' }, truncate: true /* this will ignore where and truncate the table instead */ }); }).then(function(affectedRows) { // affectedRows will be 2 return Task.findAll(); }).then(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // no programming, just reading :( }) If you are accepting values directly from the user, it might be beneficial to limit the columns that you want to actually insert. bulkCreate() accepts an options object as the second parameter. The object can have a fields parameter, (an array) to let it know which fields you want to build explicitly User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'foo' }, { username: 'bar', admin: true} ], { fields: ['username'] }).then(function() { // nope bar, you can't be admin! }) bulkCreate was originally made to be a mainstream/fast way of inserting records, however, sometimes you want the luxury of being able to insert multiple rows at once without sacrificing model validations even when you explicitly tell Sequelize which columns to sift through. You can do by adding a validate: true property to the options object. var Tasks = sequelize.define('task', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { notNull: { args: true, msg: 'name cannot be null' } } }, code: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { len: [3, 10] } } }) Tasks.bulkCreate([ {name: 'foo', code: '123'}, {code: '1234'}, {name: 'bar', code: '1'} ], { validate: true }).catch(function(errors) { /* console.log(errors) would look like: [ { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } }, { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } } ] */ }) Values of an instance If you log an instance you will notice, that there is a lot of additional stuff. In order to hide such stuff and reduce it to the very interesting information, you can use the get -attribute. Calling it with the option plain = true will only return the values of an instance. Person.create({ name: 'Rambow', firstname: 'John' }).then(function(john) { console.log(john.get({ plain: true })) }) // result: // { name: 'Rambow', // firstname: 'John', // id: 1, // createdAt: Tue, 01 May 2012 19:12:16 GMT, // updatedAt: Tue, 01 May 2012 19:12:16 GMT // } Hint: You can also transform an instance into JSON by using JSON.stringify(instance) . This will basically return the very same as values . Reloading instances If you need to get your instance in sync, you can use the method reload . It will fetch the current data from the database and overwrite the attributes of the model on which the method has been called on. Person.findOne({ where: { name: 'john' } }).then(function(person) { person.name = 'jane' console.log(person.name) // 'jane' person.reload().then(function() { console.log(person.name) // 'john' }) }) Incrementing certain values of an instance In order to increment values of an instance without running into concurrency issues, you may use increment . First of all you can define a field and the value you want to add to it. User.findById(1).then(function(user) { return user.increment('my-integer-field', {by: 2}) }).then(/* ... */) Second, you can define multiple fields and the value you want to add to them. User.findById(1).then(function(user) { return user.increment([ 'my-integer-field', 'my-very-other-field' ], {by: 2}) }).then(/* ... */) Third, you can define an object containing fields and its increment values. User.findById(1).then(function(user) { return user.increment({ 'my-integer-field': 2, 'my-very-other-field': 3 }) }).then(/* ... */) Decrementing certain values of an instance In order to decrement values of an instance without running into concurrency issues, you may use decrement .

You might recognize the syntax if you coded Ruby in the past.

This can be especially very handy if you create database entries based on a form which can be filled by a user. Using that would for example allow you to restrict the User model to set only a username and an address but not an admin flag: User.create({ username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, { fields: [ 'username' ] }).then(function(user) { // let's assume the default of isAdmin is false: console.log(user.get({ plain: true })) // => { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: false } })","title":"Creating persistent instances"},{"location":"docs/instances/#updating-saving-persisting-an-instance","text":"Now lets change some values and save changes to the database...

This is useful when you set attributes based on a previously defined object. E.g. if you get the values of an object via a form of a web app. Furthermore this is used internally for update . This is how it looks like: task.title = 'foooo' task.description = 'baaaaaar' task.save({fields: ['title']}).then(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) // The equivalent call using update looks like this: task.update({ title: 'foooo', description: 'baaaaaar'}, {fields: ['title']}).then(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) When you call save without changing any attribute, this method will execute nothing;","title":"Updating / Saving / Persisting an instance"},{"location":"docs/instances/#destroying-deleting-persistent-instances","text":"Once you created an object and got a reference to it, you can delete it from the database.

The functions you are looking for are called Model.bulkCreate Model.update Model.destroy Since you are working with multiple models, the callbacks will not return DAO instances. BulkCreate will return an array of model instances/DAOs, they will however, unlike create , not have the resulting values of autoIncrement attributes. update and destroy will return the number of affected rows. First lets look at bulkCreate User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'foo', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'bar', isAdmin: false } ]).then(function() { // Notice: There are no arguments here, as of right now you'll have to... return User.findAll(); }).then(function(users) { console.log(users) // ... in order to get the array of user objects }) To update several rows at once: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).then(function() { return Task.update( { status: 'inactive' }, /* set attributes' value */, { where: { subject: 'programming' }} /* where criteria */ ); }).spread(function(affectedCount, affectedRows) { // .update returns two values in an array, therefore we use .spread // Notice that affectedRows will only be defined in dialects which support returning: true // affectedCount will be 2 return Task.findAll(); }).then(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // the 'programming' tasks will both have a status of 'inactive' }) And delete them: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).then(function() { return Task.destroy({ where: { subject: 'programming' }, truncate: true /* this will ignore where and truncate the table instead */ }); }).then(function(affectedRows) { // affectedRows will be 2 return Task.findAll(); }).then(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // no programming, just reading :( }) If you are accepting values directly from the user, it might be beneficial to limit the columns that you want to actually insert. bulkCreate() accepts an options object as the second parameter. The object can have a fields parameter, (an array) to let it know which fields you want to build explicitly User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'foo' }, { username: 'bar', admin: true} ], { fields: ['username'] }).then(function() { // nope bar, you can't be admin! }) bulkCreate was originally made to be a mainstream/fast way of inserting records, however, sometimes you want the luxury of being able to insert multiple rows at once without sacrificing model validations even when you explicitly tell Sequelize which columns to sift through. You can do by adding a validate: true property to the options object. var Tasks = sequelize.define('task', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { notNull: { args: true, msg: 'name cannot be null' } } }, code: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { len: [3, 10] } } }) Tasks.bulkCreate([ {name: 'foo', code: '123'}, {code: '1234'}, {name: 'bar', code: '1'} ], { validate: true }).catch(function(errors) { /* console.log(errors) would look like: [ { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } }, { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } } ] */ })","title":"Working in bulk (creating, updating and destroying multiple rows at once)"},{"location":"docs/instances/#values-of-an-instance","text":"If you log an instance you will notice, that there is a lot of additional stuff.

See the transaction section for further information. Getters & setters It is possible to define 'object-property' getters and setter functions on your models, these can be used both for 'protecting' properties that map to database fields and for defining 'pseudo' properties. Getters and Setters can be defined in 2 ways (you can mix and match these 2 approaches): as part of a single property definition as part of a model options N.B: If a getter or setter is defined in both places then the function found in the relevant property definition will always take precedence. Defining as part of a property var Employee = sequelize.define('employee', { name: { type : Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false, get : function() { var title = this.getDataValue('title'); // 'this' allows you to access attributes of the instance return this.getDataValue('name') + ' (' + title + ')'; }, }, title: { type : Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false, set : function(val) { this.setDataValue('title', val.toUpperCase()); } } }); Employee .create({ name: 'John Doe', title: 'senior engineer' }) .then(function(employee) { console.log(employee.get('name')); // John Doe (SENIOR ENGINEER) console.log(employee.get('title')); // SENIOR ENGINEER }) Defining as part of the model options Below is an example of defining the getters and setters in the model options. The fullName getter, is an example of how you can define pseudo properties on your models - attributes which are not actually part of your database schema. In fact, pseudo properties can be defined in two ways: using model getters, or by using a column with the VIRTUAL datatype . Virtual datatypes can have validations, while getters for virtual attributes cannot. Note that the this.firstname and this.lastname references in the fullName getter function will trigger a call to the respective getter functions. If you do not want that then use the getDataValue() method to access the raw value (see below). var Foo = sequelize.define('foo', { firstname: Sequelize.STRING, lastname: Sequelize.STRING }, { getterMethods : { fullName : function() { return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname } }, setterMethods : { fullName : function(value) { var names = value.split(' '); this.setDataValue('firstname', names.slice(0, -1).join(' ')); this.setDataValue('lastname', names.slice(-1).join(' ')); }, } }); Helper functions for use inside getter and setter definitions retrieving an underlying property value - always use this.getDataValue() /* a getter for 'title' property */ function() { return this.getDataValue('title'); } setting an underlying property value - always use this.setDataValue() /* a setter for 'title' property */ function(title) { return this.setDataValue('title', title.toString().toLowerCase()); } N.B: It is important to stick to using the setDataValue() and getDataValue() functions (as opposed to accessing the underlying \"data values\" property directly) - doing so protects your custom getters and setters from changes in the underlying model implementations. Validations Model validations, allow you to specify format/content/inheritance validations for each attribute of the model. Validations are automatically run on create , update and save . You can also call validate() to manually validate an instance. The validations are implemented by validator.js . var ValidateMe = sequelize.define('foo', { foo: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { is: [\"^[a-z]+$\",'i'], // will only allow letters is: /^[a-z]+$/i, // same as the previous example using real RegExp not: [\"[a-z]\",'i'], // will not allow letters isEmail: true, // checks for email format (foo@bar.com) isUrl: true, // checks for url format (http://foo.com) isIP: true, // checks for IPv4 (129.89.23.1) or IPv6 format isIPv4: true, // checks for IPv4 (129.89.23.1) isIPv6: true, // checks for IPv6 format isAlpha: true, // will only allow letters isAlphanumeric: true, // will only allow alphanumeric characters, so \"_abc\" will fail isNumeric: true, // will only allow numbers isInt: true, // checks for valid integers isFloat: true, // checks for valid floating point numbers isDecimal: true, // checks for any numbers isLowercase: true, // checks for lowercase isUppercase: true, // checks for uppercase notNull: true, // won't allow null isNull: true, // only allows null notEmpty: true, // don't allow empty strings equals: 'specific value', // only allow a specific value contains: 'foo', // force specific substrings notIn: [['foo', 'bar']], // check the value is not one of these isIn: [['foo', 'bar']], // check the value is one of these notContains: 'bar', // don't allow specific substrings len: [2,10], // only allow values with length between 2 and 10 isUUID: 4, // only allow uuids isDate: true, // only allow date strings isAfter: \"2011-11-05\", // only allow date strings after a specific date isBefore: \"2011-11-05\", // only allow date strings before a specific date max: 23, // only allow values min: 23, // only allow values >= 23 isArray: true, // only allow arrays isCreditCard: true, // check for valid credit card numbers // custom validations are also possible: isEven: function(value) { if(parseInt(value) % 2 != 0) { throw new Error('Only even values are allowed!') // we also are in the model's context here, so this.otherField // would get the value of otherField if it existed } } } } }); Note that where multiple arguments need to be passed to the built-in validation functions, the arguments to be passed must be in an array. But if a single array argument is to be passed, for instance an array of acceptable strings for isIn , this will be interpreted as multiple string arguments instead of one array argument. To work around this pass a single-length array of arguments, such as [['one', 'two']] as shown above. To use a custom error message instead of that provided by validator.js, use an object instead of the plain value or array of arguments, for example a validator which needs no argument can be given a custom message with isInt: { msg: \"Must be an integer number of pennies\" } or if arguments need to also be passed add an args property: isIn: { args: [['en', 'zh']], msg: \"Must be English or Chinese\" } When using custom validator functions the error message will be whatever message the thrown Error object holds. See the validator.js project for more details on the built in validation methods. Hint: You can also define a custom function for the logging part. Just pass a function. The first parameter will be the string that is logged. Validators and allowNull If a particular field of a model is set to allow null (with allowNull: true ) and that value has been set to null , its validators do not run. This means you can, for instance, have a string field which validates its length to be at least 5 characters, but which also allows null . Model validations Validations can also be defined to check the model after the field-specific validators. Using this you could, for example, ensure either neither of latitude and longitude are set or both, and fail if one but not the other is set. Model validator methods are called with the model object's context and are deemed to fail if they throw an error, otherwise pass. This is just the same as with custom field-specific validators. Any error messages collected are put in the validation result object alongside the field validation errors, with keys named after the failed validation method's key in the validate option object. Even though there can only be one error message for each model validation method at any one time, it is presented as a single string error in an array, to maximize consistency with the field errors. An example: var Pub = Sequelize.define('pub', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, address: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, latitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -90, max: 90 } }, longitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -180, max: 180 } }, }, { validate: { bothCoordsOrNone: function() { if ((this.latitude === null) !== (this.longitude === null)) { throw new Error('Require either both latitude and longitude or neither') } } } }) In this simple case an object fails validation if either latitude or longitude is given, but not both. If we try to build one with an out-of-range latitude and no longitude, raging_bullock_arms.validate() might return { 'latitude': ['Invalid number: latitude'], 'bothCoordsOrNone': ['Require either both latitude and longitude or neither'] } Configuration You can also influence the way Sequelize handles your column names: var Bar = sequelize.define('bar', { /* bla */ }, { // don't add the timestamp attributes (updatedAt, createdAt) timestamps: false, // don't delete database entries but set the newly added attribute deletedAt // to the current date (when deletion was done). paranoid will only work if // timestamps are enabled paranoid: true, // don't use camelcase for automatically added attributes but underscore style // so updatedAt will be updated_at underscored: true, // disable the modification of table names; By default, sequelize will automatically // transform all passed model names (first parameter of define) into plural. // if you don't want that, set the following freezeTableName: true, // define the table's name tableName: 'my_very_custom_table_name' }) If you want sequelize to handle timestamps, but only want some of them, or want your timestamps to be called something else, you can override each column individually: var Foo = sequelize.define('foo', { /* bla */ }, { // don't forget to enable timestamps! timestamps: true, // I don't want createdAt createdAt: false, // I want updatedAt to actually be called updateTimestamp updatedAt: 'updateTimestamp' // And deletedAt to be called destroyTime (remember to enable paranoid for this to work) deletedAt: 'destroyTime', paranoid: true }) You can also change the database engine, e.g. to MyISAM. InnoDB is the default. var Person = sequelize.define('person', { /* attributes */ }, { engine: 'MYISAM' }) // or globally var sequelize = new Sequelize(db, user, pw, { define: { engine: 'MYISAM' } }) Finally you can specify a comment for the table in MySQL and PG var Person = sequelize.define('person', { /* attributes */ }, { comment: \"I'm a table comment!\" }) Import You can also store your model definitions in a single file using the import method. The returned object is exactly the same as defined in the imported file's function. Since v1:5.0 of Sequelize the import is cached, so you won't run into troubles when calling the import of a file twice or more often. // in your server file - e.g. app.js var Project = sequelize.import(__dirname + \"/path/to/models/project\") // The model definition is done in /path/to/models/project.js // As you might notice, the DataTypes are the very same as explained above module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"project\", { name: DataTypes.STRING, description: DataTypes.TEXT }) } The import method can also accept a callback as an argument. sequelize.import('project', function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"project\", { name: DataTypes.STRING, description: DataTypes.TEXT }) }) Database synchronization When starting a new project you won't have a database structure and using Sequelize you won't need to. Just specify your model structures and let the library do the rest. Currently supported is the creation and deletion of tables: // Create the tables: Project.sync() Task.sync() // Force the creation! Project.sync({force: true}) // this will drop the table first and re-create it afterwards // drop the tables: Project.drop() Task.drop() // event handling: Project.[sync|drop]().then(function() { // ok ... everything is nice! }).catch(function(error) { // oooh, did you enter wrong database credentials? }) Because synchronizing and dropping all of your tables might be a lot of lines to write, you can also let Sequelize do the work for you: // Sync all models that aren't already in the database sequelize.sync() // Force sync all models sequelize.sync({force: true}) // Drop all tables sequelize.drop() // emit handling: sequelize.[sync|drop]().then(function() { // woot woot }).catch(function(error) { // whooops }) Because .sync({ force: true }) is destructive operation, you can use match option as an additional safety check. match option tells sequelize to match a regex against the database name before syncing - a safety check for cases where force: true is used in tests but not live code. // This will run .sync() only if database name ends with '_test' sequelize.sync({ force: true, match: /_test$/ }); Expansion of models Sequelize allows you to pass custom methods to a model and its instances. Just do the following: var Foo = sequelize.define('foo', { /* attributes */}, { classMethods: { method1: function(){ return 'smth' } }, instanceMethods: { method2: function() { return 'foo' } } }) // Example: Foo.method1() Foo.build().method2() Of course you can also access the instance's data and generate virtual getters: var User = sequelize.define('user', { firstname: Sequelize.STRING, lastname: Sequelize.STRING }, { instanceMethods: { getFullname: function() { return [this.firstname, this.lastname].join(' ') } } }) // Example: User.build({ firstname: 'foo', lastname: 'bar' }).getFullname() // 'foo bar' You can also set custom methods to all of your models during the instantiation: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // Other options during the initialization could be here define: { classMethods: { method1: function() {}, method2: function() {} }, instanceMethods: { method3: function() {} } } }) // Example: var Foo = sequelize.define('foo', { /* attributes */}); Foo.method1() Foo.method2() Foo.build().method3() Indexes Sequelize supports adding indexes to the model definition which will be created during Model.sync() or sequelize.sync . sequelize.define('user', {}, { indexes: [ // Create a unique index on email { unique: true, fields: ['email'] }, // Creates a gin index on data with the jsonb_path_ops operator { fields: ['data'], using: 'gin', operator: 'jsonb_path_ops' }, // By default index name will be [table]_[fields] // Creates a multi column partial index { name: 'public_by_author', fields: ['author', 'status'], where: { status: 'public' } }, // A BTREE index with a ordered field { name: 'title_index', method: 'BTREE', fields: ['author', {attribute: 'title', collate: 'en_US', order: 'DESC', length: 5}] } ] })","title":"Definition"},{"location":"docs/models-definition/#definition","text":"To define mappings between a model and a table, use the define method.

Even though there can only be one error message for each model validation method at any one time, it is presented as a single string error in an array, to maximize consistency with the field errors. An example: var Pub = Sequelize.define('pub', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, address: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, latitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -90, max: 90 } }, longitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -180, max: 180 } }, }, { validate: { bothCoordsOrNone: function() { if ((this.latitude === null) !== (this.longitude === null)) { throw new Error('Require either both latitude and longitude or neither') } } } }) In this simple case an object fails validation if either latitude or longitude is given, but not both. If we try to build one with an out-of-range latitude and no longitude, raging_bullock_arms.validate() might return { 'latitude': ['Invalid number: latitude'], 'bothCoordsOrNone': ['Require either both latitude and longitude or neither'] }","title":"Model validations"},{"location":"docs/models-definition/#configuration","text":"You can also influence the way Sequelize handles your column names: var Bar = sequelize.define('bar', { /* bla */ }, { // don't add the timestamp attributes (updatedAt, createdAt) timestamps: false, // don't delete database entries but set the newly added attribute deletedAt // to the current date (when deletion was done). paranoid will only work if // timestamps are enabled paranoid: true, // don't use camelcase for automatically added attributes but underscore style // so updatedAt will be updated_at underscored: true, // disable the modification of table names; By default, sequelize will automatically // transform all passed model names (first parameter of define) into plural. // if you don't want that, set the following freezeTableName: true, // define the table's name tableName: 'my_very_custom_table_name' }) If you want sequelize to handle timestamps, but only want some of them, or want your timestamps to be called something else, you can override each column individually: var Foo = sequelize.define('foo', { /* bla */ }, { // don't forget to enable timestamps! timestamps: true, // I don't want createdAt createdAt: false, // I want updatedAt to actually be called updateTimestamp updatedAt: 'updateTimestamp' // And deletedAt to be called destroyTime (remember to enable paranoid for this to work) deletedAt: 'destroyTime', paranoid: true }) You can also change the database engine, e.g. to MyISAM.

They do not return plain objects but instead return model instances. Because finder methods return model instances you can call any model instance member on the result as described in the documentation for instances . In this document we'll explore what finder methods can do: find - Search for one specific element in the database // search for known ids Project.findById(123).then(function(project) { // project will be an instance of Project and stores the content of the table entry // with id 123. if such an entry is not defined you will get null }) // search for attributes Project.findOne({ where: {title: 'aProject'} }).then(function(project) { // project will be the first entry of the Projects table with the title 'aProject' || null }) Project.findOne({ where: {title: 'aProject'}, attributes: ['id', ['name', 'title']] }).then(function(project) { // project will be the first entry of the Projects table with the title 'aProject' || null // project.title will contain the name of the project }) findOrCreate - Search for a specific element or create it if not available The method findOrCreate can be used to check if a certain element already exists in the database. If that is the case the method will result in a respective instance. If the element does not yet exist, it will be created. Let's assume we have an empty database with a User model which has a username and a job . User .findOrCreate({where: {username: 'sdepold'}, defaults: {job: 'Technical Lead JavaScript'}}) .spread(function(user, created) { console.log(user.get({ plain: true })) console.log(created) /* { username: 'sdepold', job: 'Technical Lead JavaScript', id: 1, createdAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET), updatedAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET) } created: true */ }) The code created a new instance. So when we already have an instance ... User .create({ username: 'fnord', job: 'omnomnom' }) .then(function() { User .findOrCreate({where: {username: 'fnord'}, defaults: {job: 'something else'}}) .spread(function(user, created) { console.log(user.get({ plain: true })) console.log(created) /* { username: 'fnord', job: 'omnomnom', id: 2, createdAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET), updatedAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET) } created: false */ }) }) ... the existing entry will not be changed. See the job of the second user, and the fact that created was false. findAndCountAll - Search for multiple elements in the database, returns both data and total count This is a convenience method that combines findAll and count (see below) this is useful when dealing with queries related to pagination where you want to retrieve data with a limit and offset but also need to know the total number of records that match the query: The success handler will always receive an object with two properties: count - an integer, total number records matching the where clause rows - an array of objects, the records matching the where clause, within the limit and offset range Project .findAndCountAll({ where: { title: { $like: 'foo%' } }, offset: 10, limit: 2 }) .then(function(result) { console.log(result.count); console.log(result.rows); }); findAndCountAll also supports includes. Only the includes that are marked as required will be added to the count part: Suppose you want to find all users who have a profile attached: User.findAndCountAll({ include: [ { model: Profile, required: true} ], limit: 3 }); Because the include for Profile has required set it will result in an inner join, and only the users who have a profile will be counted. If we remove required from the include, both users with and without profiles will be counted. Adding a where clause to the include automatically makes it required: User.findAndCountAll({ include: [ { model: Profile, where: { active: true }} ], limit: 3 }); The query above will only count users who have an active profile, because required is implicitly set to true when you add a where clause to the include. The options object that you pass to findAndCountAll is the same as for findAll (described below). findAll - Search for multiple elements in the database // find multiple entries Project.findAll().then(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of all Project instances }) // also possible: Project.all().then(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of all Project instances }) // search for specific attributes - hash usage Project.findAll({ where: { name: 'A Project' } }).then(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Project instances with the specified name }) // search with string replacements Project.findAll({ where: [\"id > ?\", 25] }).then(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Projects having a greater id than 25 }) // search within a specific range Project.findAll({ where: { id: [1,2,3] } }).then(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Projects having the id 1, 2 or 3 // this is actually doing an IN query }) Project.findAll({ where: { id: { $and: {a: 5} // AND (a = 5) $or: [{a: 5}, {a: 6}] // (a = 5 OR a = 6) $gt: 6, // id > 6 $gte: 6, // id >= 6 $lt: 10, // id < 10 $lte: 10, // id <= 10 $ne: 20, // id != 20 $between: [6, 10], // BETWEEN 6 AND 10 $notBetween: [11, 15], // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15 $in: [1, 2], // IN [1, 2] $notIn: [1, 2], // NOT IN [1, 2] $like: '%hat', // LIKE '%hat' $notLike: '%hat' // NOT LIKE '%hat' $iLike: '%hat' // ILIKE '%hat' (case insensitive) (PG only) $notILike: '%hat' // NOT ILIKE '%hat' (PG only) $overlap: [1, 2] // && [1, 2] (PG array overlap operator) $contains: [1, 2] // @> [1, 2] (PG array contains operator) $contained: [1, 2] // <@ [1, 2] (PG array contained by operator) $any: [2,3] // ANY ARRAY[2, 3]::INTEGER (PG only) }, status: { $not: false, // status NOT FALSE } } }) Complex filtering / OR / NOT queries It's possible to do complex where queries with multiple levels of nested AND, OR and NOT conditions. In order to do that you can use $or , $and or $not : Project.findOne({ where: { name: 'a project', $or: [ { id: [1,2,3] }, { id: { $gt: 10 } } ] } }) Project.findOne({ where: { name: 'a project', id: { $or: [ [1,2,3], { $gt: 10 } ] } } }) Both pieces of code code will generate the following: SELECT * FROM `Projects` WHERE ( `Projects`.`name` = 'a project' AND (`Projects`.`id` IN (1,2,3) OR `Projects`.`id` > 10) ) LIMIT 1; $not example: Project.findOne({ where: { name: 'a project', $not: [ { id: [1,2,3] }, { array: { $contains: [3,4,5] } } ] } }); Will generate: SELECT * FROM `Projects` WHERE ( `Projects`.`name` = 'a project' AND NOT (`Projects`.`id` IN (1,2,3) OR `Projects`.`array` @> ARRAY[1,2,3]::INTEGER[]) ) LIMIT 1; Manipulating the dataset with limit, offset, order and group To get more relevant data, you can use limit, offset, order and grouping: // limit the results of the query Project.findAll({ limit: 10 }) // step over the first 10 elements Project.findAll({ offset: 10 }) // step over the first 10 elements, and take 2 Project.findAll({ offset: 10, limit: 2 }) The syntax for grouping and ordering are equal, so below it is only explained with a single example for group, and the rest for order. Everything you see below can also be done for group Project.findAll({order: 'title DESC'}) // yields ORDER BY title DESC Project.findAll({group: 'name'}) // yields GROUP BY name Notice how in the two examples above, the string provided is inserted verbatim into the query, i.e. column names are not escaped. When you provide a string to order/group, this will always be the case. If you want to escape column names, you should provide an array of arguments, even though you only want to order/group by a single column something.findOne({ order: [ 'name', // will return `name` 'username DESC', // will return `username DESC` -- i.e. don't do it! ['username', 'DESC'], // will return `username` DESC sequelize.fn('max', sequelize.col('age')), // will return max(`age`) [sequelize.fn('max', sequelize.col('age')), 'DESC'], // will return max(`age`) DESC [sequelize.fn('otherfunction', sequelize.col('col1'), 12, 'lalala'), 'DESC'], // will return otherfunction(`col1`, 12, 'lalala') DESC [sequelize.fn('otherfunction', sequelize.fn('awesomefunction', sequelize.col('col'))), 'DESC'] // will return otherfunction(awesomefunction(`col`)) DESC, This nesting is potentially infinite! [{ raw: 'otherfunction(awesomefunction(`col`))' }, 'DESC'] // This won't be quoted, but direction will be added ] }) To recap, the elements of the order/group array can be the following: String - will be quoted Array - first element will be quoted, second will be appended verbatim Object - Raw will be added verbatim without quoting Everything else is ignored, and if raw is not set, the query will fail Sequelize.fn and Sequelize.col returns functions and quoted cools Raw queries Sometimes you might be expecting a massive dataset that you just want to display, without manipulation. For each row you select, Sequelize creates an instance with functions for update, delete, get associations etc. If you have thousands of rows, this might take some time. If you only need the raw data and don't want to update anything, you can do like this to get the raw data. // Are you expecting a massive dataset from the DB, // and don't want to spend the time building DAOs for each entry? // You can pass an extra query option to get the raw data instead: Project.findAll({ where: { ... }, raw: true }) count - Count the occurrences of elements in the database There is also a method for counting database objects: Project.count().then(function(c) { console.log(\"There are \" + c + \" projects!\") }) Project.count({ where: [\"id > ?\", 25] }).then(function(c) { console.log(\"There are \" + c + \" projects with an id greater than 25.\") }) max - Get the greatest value of a specific attribute within a specific table And here is a method for getting the max value of an attribute:f /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.max('age').then(function(max) { // this will return 40 }) Project.max('age', { where: { age: { lt: 20 } } }).then(function(max) { // will be 10 }) min - Get the least value of a specific attribute within a specific table And here is a method for getting the min value of an attribute: /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.min('age').then(function(min) { // this will return 5 }) Project.min('age', { where: { age: { $gt: 5 } } }).then(function(min) { // will be 10 }) sum - Sum the value of specific attributes In order to calculate the sum over a specific column of a table, you can use the sum method. /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.sum('age').then(function(sum) { // this will return 55 }) Project.sum('age', { where: { age: { $gt: 5 } } }).then(function(sum) { // will be 50 }) Eager loading When you are retrieving data from the database there is a fair chance that you also want to get associations with the same query - this is called eager loading. The basic idea behind that, is the use of the attribute include when you are calling find or findAll . Lets assume the following setup: var User = sequelize.define('user', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) , Task = sequelize.define('task', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) , Tool = sequelize.define('tool', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) Task.belongsTo(User) User.hasMany(Task) User.hasMany(Tool, { as: 'Instruments' }) sequelize.sync().then(function() { // this is where we continue ... }) OK. So, first of all, let's load all tasks with their associated user. Task.findAll({ include: [ User ] }).then(function(tasks) { console.log(JSON.stringify(tasks)) /* [{ \"name\": \"A Task\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"userId\": 1, \"user\": { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\" } }] */ }) Notice that the accessor (the User property in the resulting instance) is singular because the association is one-to-something. Next thing: Loading of data with many-to-something associations! User.findAll({ include: [ Task ] }).then(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"tasks\": [{ \"name\": \"A Task\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"userId\": 1 }] }] */ }) Notice that the accessor (the Tasks property in the resulting instance) is plural because the association is many-to-something. If an association is aliased (using the as option), you must specify this alias when including the model. Notice how the user's Tool s are aliased as Instruments above. In order to get that right you have to specify the model you want to load, as well as the alias: User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Tool, as: 'Instruments' }] }).then(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"Instruments\": [{ \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"userId\": 1 }] }] */ }) When eager loading we can also filter the associated model using where . This will return all User s in which the where clause of Tool model matches rows. User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Tool, as: 'Instruments', where: { name: { $like: '%ooth%' } } }] }).then(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"Instruments\": [{ \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"userId\": 1 }] }], [{ \"name\": \"John Smith\", \"id\": 2, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"Instruments\": [{ \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"userId\": 1 }] }], */ }) When an eager loaded model is filtered using include.where then include.required is implicitly set to true . This means that an inner join is done returning parent models with any matching children. Including everything To include all attributes, you can pass a single object with all: true : User.findAll({ include: [{ all: true }]}); Including soft deleted records In case you want to eager load soft deleted records you can do that by setting include.paranoid to true User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Tool, where: { name: { $like: '%ooth%' } }, paranoid: true // query and loads the soft deleted records }] }); Ordering Eager Loaded Associations In the case of a one-to-many relationship. Company.findAll({ include: [ Division ], order: [ [ Division, 'name' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ Division ], order: [ [ Division, 'name', 'DESC' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' } ], order: [ [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' }, 'name' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' } ], order: [ [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' }, 'name', 'DESC' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, include: [ Department ] } ], order: [ [ Division, Department, 'name' ] ] }); In the case of many-to-many joins, you are also able to sort by attributes in the through table. Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, include: [ Department ] } ], order: [ [ Division, DepartmentDivision, 'name' ] ] }); Nested eager loading You can use nested eager loading to load all related models of a related model: User.findAll({ include: [ {model: Tool, as: 'Instruments', include: [ {model: Teacher, include: [ /* etc */]} ]} ] }).then(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"Instruments\": [{ // 1:M and N:M association \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"userId\": 1, \"Teacher\": { // 1:1 association \"name\": \"Jimi Hendrix\" } }] }] */ }) This will produce an outer join. However, a where clause on a related model will create an inner join and return only the instances that have matching sub-models. To return all parent instances, you should add required: false . User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Tool, as: 'Instruments', include: [{ model: Teacher, where: { school: \"Woodstock Music School\" }, required: false }] }] }).then(function(users) { /* ... */ }) The query above will return all users, and all their instruments, but only those teachers associated with Woodstock Music School .

This allows you to easily map a query to a predefined model sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM projects', { model: Projects }).then(function(projects){ // Each record will now be a instance of Project }) Replacements Replacements in a query can be done in two different ways, either using named parameters (starting with : ), or unnamed, represented by a ? . Replacements are passed in the options object. If an array is passed, ? will be replaced in the order that they appear in the array If an object is passed, :key will be replaced with the keys from that object. If the object contains keys not found in the query or vice versa, an exception will be thrown. sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = ?', { replacements: ['active'], type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT } ).then(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) sequelize.query('SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = :status ', { replacements: { status: 'active' }, type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT } ).then(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) Bind Parameter Bind parameters are like replacements. Except replacements are escaped and inserted into the query by sequelize before the query is sent to the database, while bind parameters are sent to the database outside the SQL query text. A query can have either bind parameters or replacements. Only SQLite and PostgreSQL support bind parameters. Other dialects will insert them into the SQL query in the same way it is done for replacements. Bind parameters are referred to by either $1, $2, ... (numeric) or $key (alpha-numeric). This is independent of the dialect. If an array is passed, $1 is bound to the 1st element in the array ( bind[0] ) If an object is passed, $key is bound to object['key'] . Each key must begin with a non-numeric char. $1 is not a valid key, even if object['1'] exists. In either case $$ can be used to escape a literal $ sign. The array or object must contain all bound values or Sequelize will throw an exception. This applies even to cases in which the database may ignore the bound parameter. The database may add further restrictions to this. Bind parameters cannot be SQL keywords, nor table or column names. They are also ignored in quoted text or data.

Scopes can include all the same attributes as regular finders, where , include , limit etc. Scopes are defined in the model definition and can be finder objects, or functions returning finder objects - except for the default scope, which can only be an object: var Project = sequelize.define('project', { // Attributes }, { defaultScope: { where: { active: true } }, scopes: { deleted: { where: { deleted: true } }, activeUsers: { include: [ { model: User, where: { active: true }} ] } random: function () { return { where: { someNumber: Math.random() } } }, accessLevel: function (value) { return { where: { accessLevel: { $gte: value } } } } } }); You can also add scopes after a model has been defined by calling addScope . This is especially useful for scopes with includes, where the model in the include might not be defined at the time the other model is being defined. The default scope is always applied. This means, that with the model definition above, Project.findAll() will create the following query: SELECT * FROM projects WHERE active = true The default scope can be removed by calling .unscoped() , .scope(null) , or by invoking another scope: Project.scope('deleted').findAll(); // Removes the default scope SELECT * FROM projects WHERE deleted = true Usage Scopes are applied by calling .scope on the model definition, passing the name of one or more scopes. .scope returns a fully functional model instance with all the regular methods: .findAll , .update , .count , .destroy etc. You can save this model instance and reuse it later: var DeletedProjects = Project.scope('deleted'); DeletedProjects.findAll(); // some time passes // let's look for deleted projects again! DeletedProjects.findAll(); Scopes apply to .find , .findAll , .count , .update and .destroy . Scopes which are functions can be invoked in two ways. If the scope does not take any arguments it can be invoked as normally. If the scope takes arguments, pass an object: Project.scope('random', { method: ['accessLevel', 19]}).findAll(); SELECT * FROM projects WHERE someNumber = 42 AND accessLevel >= 19 Merging Several scopes can be applied simultaneously by passing an array of scopes to .scope , or by passing the scopes as consecutive arguments. // These two are equivalent Project.scope('deleted', 'activeUsers').findAll(); Project.scope(['deleted', 'activeUsers']).findAll(); SELECT * FROM projects INNER JOIN users ON projects.userId = users.id AND users.active = true If you want to apply another scope alongside the default scope, pass the key defaultScope to .scope : Project.scope('defaultScope', 'deleted').findAll(); SELECT * FROM projects WHERE active = true AND deleted = true When invoking several scopes, keys from subsequent scopes will overwrite previous ones (similar to _.assign ). Consider two scopes: { scope1: { where: { firstName: 'bob', age: { $gt: 20 } }, limit: 2 }, scope2: { where: { age: { $gt: 30 } }, limit: 10 } } Calling .scope('scope1', 'scope2') will yield the following query WHERE firstName = 'bob' AND age > 30 LIMIT 10 Note how limit and age are overwritten by scope2 , while firstName is preserved. limit , offset , order , paranoid , lock and raw are overwritten, while where and include are shallowly merged. This means that identical keys in the where objects, and subsequent includes of the same model will both overwrite each other. The same merge logic applies when passing a find object directly to findAll on a scoped model: Project.scope('deleted').findAll({ where: { firstName: 'john' } }) WHERE deleted = true AND firstName = 'john' Here the deleted scope is merged with the finder. If we were to pass where: { firstName: 'john', deleted: false } to the finder, the deleted scope would be overwritten. Associations Sequelize has two different but related scope concepts in relation to associations. The difference is subtle but important: Association scopes Allow you to specify default attributes when getting and setting associations - useful when implementing polymorphic associations. This scope is only invoked on the association between the two models, when using the get , set , add and create associated model functions Scopes on associated models Allows you to apply default and other scopes when fetching associations, and allows you to pass a scoped model when creating associations. These scopes both apply to regular finds on the model and to find through the association. As an example, consider the models Post and Comment. Comment is associated to several other models (Image, Video etc.) and the association between Comment and other models is polymorphic, which means that Comment stores a commentable column, in addition to the foreign key commentable_id . The polymorphic association can be implemented with an association scope : this.Post.hasMany(this.Comment, { foreignKey: 'commentable_id', scope: { commentable: 'post' } }); When calling post.getComments() , this will automatically add WHERE commentable = 'post' . Similarly, when adding new comments to a post, commentable will automagically be set to 'post' . The association scope is meant to live in the background without the programmer having to worry about it - it cannot be disabled. For a more complete polymorphic example, see Association scopes Consider then, that Post has a default scope which only shows active posts: where: { active: true } . This scope lives on the associated model (Post), and not on the association like the commentable scope did. Just like the default scope is applied when calling Post.findAll() , it is also applied when calling User.getPosts() - this will only return the active posts for that user. To disable the default scope, pass scope: null to the getter: User.getPosts({ scope: null }) . Similarly, if you want to apply other scopes, pass an array like you would to .scope : User.getPosts({ scope: ['scope1', 'scope2']}); If you want to create a shortcut method to a scope on an associated model, you can pass the scoped model to the association.

The key difference is that the managed transaction uses a callback that expects a promise to be returned to it while the unmanaged transaction returns a promise. Managed transaction (auto-callback) Managed transactions handle committing or rolling back the transaction automagically. You start a managed transaction by passing a callback to sequelize.transaction . Notice how the callback passed to transaction returns a promise chain, and does not explicitly call t.commit() nor t.rollback() . If all promises in the returned chain are resolved successfully the transaction is committed. If one or several of the promises are rejected, the transaction is rolled back. return sequelize.transaction(function (t) { // chain all your queries here. make sure you return them. return User.create({ firstName: 'Abraham', lastName: 'Lincoln' }, {transaction: t}).then(function (user) { return user.setShooter({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Boothe' }, {transaction: t}); }); }).then(function (result) { // Transaction has been committed // result is whatever the result of the promise chain returned to the transaction callback }).catch(function (err) { // Transaction has been rolled back // err is whatever rejected the promise chain returned to the transaction callback }); Throw errors to rollback When using the managed transaction you should never commit or rollback the transaction manually. If all queries are successful, but you still want to rollback the transaction (for example because of a validation failure) you should throw an error to break and reject the chain: return sequelize.transaction(function (t) { return User.create({ firstName: 'Abraham', lastName: 'Lincoln' }, {transaction: t}).then(function (user) { // Woops, the query was successful but we still want to roll back! throw new Error(); }); }); Automatically pass transactions to all queries In the examples above, the transaction is still manually passed, by passing { transaction: t } as the second argument. To automatically pass the transaction to all queries you must install the continuation local storage (CLS) module and instantiate a namespace in your own code: var cls = require('continuation-local-storage'), namespace = cls.createNamespace('my-very-own-namespace'); To enable CLS you must tell sequelize which namespace to use by setting it as a property on the sequelize constructor: var Sequelize = require('sequelize'); Sequelize.cls = namespace; new Sequelize(....); Notice, that the cls property must be set on the constructor , not on an instance of sequelize. This means that all instances will share the same namespace, and that CLS is all-or-nothing - you cannot enable it only for some instances. CLS works like a thread-local storage for callbacks. What this means in practice is, that different callback chains can access local variables by using the CLS namespace. When CLS is enabled sequelize will set the transaction property on the namespace when a new transaction is created. Since variables set within a callback chain are private to that chain several concurrent transactions can exist at the same time: sequelize.transaction(function (t1) { namespace.get('transaction') === t1; // true }); sequelize.transaction(function (t2) { namespace.get('transaction') === t2; // true }); In most case you won't need to access namespace.get('transaction') directly, since all queries will automatically look for a transaction on the namespace: sequelize.transaction(function (t1) { // With CLS enabled, the user will be created inside the transaction return User.create({ name: 'Alice' }); }); Concurrent/Partial transactions You can have concurrent transactions within a sequence of queries or have some of them excluded from any transactions. Use the {transaction: } option to control which transaction a query belong to: Without CLS enabled sequelize.transaction(function (t1) { return sequelize.transaction(function (t2) { // With CLS enable, queries here will by default use t2 // Pass in the `transaction` option to define/alter the transaction they belong to. return Promise.all([ User.create({ name: 'Bob' }, { transaction: null }), User.create({ name: 'Mallory' }, { transaction: t1 }), User.create({ name: 'John' }) // this would default to t2 ]); }); }); Isolation levels The possible isolations levels to use when starting a transaction: Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.READ_UNCOMMITTED // \"READ UNCOMMITTED\" Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.READ_COMMITTED // \"READ COMMITTED\" Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.REPEATABLE_READ // \"REPEATABLE READ\" Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.SERIALIZABLE // \"SERIALIZABLE\" By default, sequelize uses \"REPEATABLE READ\". If you want to use a different isolation level, pass in the desired level as the first argument: return sequelize.transaction({ isolationLevel: Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.SERIALIZABLE }, function (t) { // your transactions }); Unmanaged transaction (then-callback) Unmanaged transactions force you to manually rollback or commit the transaction. If you don't do that, the transaction will hang until it times out. To start an unmanaged transaction, call sequelize.transaction() without a callback (you can still pass an options object) and call then on the returned promise. Notice that commit() and rollback() returns a promise. return sequelize.transaction().then(function (t) { return User.create({ firstName: 'Homer', lastName: 'Simpson' }, {transaction: t}).then(function (user) { return user.addSibling({ firstName: 'Lisa', lastName: 'Simpson' }, {transaction: t}); }).then(function () { return t.commit(); }).catch(function (err) { return t.rollback(); }); }); Options The transaction method can be called with an options object as the first argument, that allows the configuration of the transaction. return sequelize.transaction({ /* options */ }); The following options (with it's default values) are available: { autocommit: true, isolationLevel: 'REPEATABLE_READ', deferrable: 'NOT DEFERRABLE' // implicit default of postgres } The isolationLevel can either be set globally when initializing the Sequelize instance or locally for every transaction: // globally new Sequelize('db', 'user', 'pw', { isolationLevel: Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.SERIALIZABLE }); // locally sequelize.transaction({ isolationLevel: Sequelize.Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.SERIALIZABLE }); The deferrable option triggers an additional query after the transaction start that optionally set the constraint checks to be deferred or immediate.

Use it the following way: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username'[, 'password']) This will save the passed database credentials and provide all further methods. Furthermore you can specify a non-default host/port: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { host: \"my.server.tld\", port: 12345 }) If you just don't have a password: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username') // or var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', null) You can also use a connection string: var sequelize = new Sequelize('mysql://user:pass@example.com:9821/dbname', { // Look to the next section for possible options }) Options Besides the host and the port, Sequelize comes with a whole bunch of options. Here they are: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // custom host; default: localhost host: 'my.server.tld', // custom port; default: 3306 port: 12345, // custom protocol // - default: 'tcp' // - added in: v1.5.0 // - postgres only, useful for heroku protocol: null, // disable logging; default: console.log logging: false, // the sql dialect of the database // - default is 'mysql' // - currently supported: 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'postgres', 'mariadb', 'mssql' dialect: 'mysql', // you can also pass any dialect options to the underlying dialect library // - default is empty // - currently supported: 'mysql', 'mariadb', 'postgres', 'mssql' dialectOptions: { socketPath: '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock', supportBigNumbers: true, bigNumberStrings: true }, // the storage engine for sqlite // - default ':memory:' storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite', // disable inserting undefined values as NULL // - default: false omitNull: true, // a flag for using a native library or not. // in the case of 'pg' -- set this to true will allow SSL support // - default: false native: true, // Specify options, which are used when sequelize.define is called. // The following example: // define: {timestamps: false} // is basically the same as: // sequelize.define(name, attributes, { timestamps: false }) // so defining the timestamps for each model will be not necessary // Below you can see the possible keys for settings. All of them are explained on this page define: { underscored: false freezeTableName: false, syncOnAssociation: true, charset: 'utf8', dialectOptions: { collate: 'utf8_general_ci' }, classMethods: {method1: function() {}}, instanceMethods: {method2: function() {}}, timestamps: true }, // similar for sync: you can define this to always force sync for models sync: { force: true }, // sync after each association (see below). If set to false, you need to sync manually after setting all associations. Default: true syncOnAssociation: true, // use pooling in order to reduce db connection overload and to increase speed // currently only for mysql and postgresql (since v1.5.0) pool: { maxConnections: 5, maxIdleTime: 30}, // language is used to determine how to translate words into singular or plural form based on the [lingo project](https://github.com/visionmedia/lingo) // options are: en [default], es language: 'en', // isolation level of each transaction. Defaults to REPEATABLE_READ // options are: // READ_UNCOMMITTED // READ_COMMITTED // REPEATABLE_READ // SERIALIZABLE isolationLevel: Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.REPEATABLE_READ }) Hint: You can also define a custom function for the logging part. Just pass a function. The first parameter will be the string that is logged. Read replication Sequelize supports read replication, i.e. having multiple servers that you can connect to when you want to do a SELECT query. When you do read replication, you specify one or more servers to act as read replicas, and one server to act as the write master, which handles all writes and updates and propagates them to the replicas (note that the actual replication process is not handled by Sequelize, but should be set up in MySql). var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', null, null, { dialect: 'mysql', port: 3306 replication: { read: [ { host: '8.8.8.8', username: 'anotherusernamethanroot', password: 'lolcats!' }, { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } ], write: { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } }, pool: { // If you want to override the options used for the read pool you can do so here maxConnections: 20, maxIdleTime: 30000 }, }) If you have any general settings that apply to all replicas you do not need to provide them for each instance. In the code above, database name and port is propagated to all replicas. The same will happen for user and password, if you leave them out for any of the replicas. Each replica has the following options: host , port , username , password , database . Sequelize uses a pool to manage connections to your replicas. The default options are: { maxConnections: 10, minConnections: 0, maxIdleTime: 1000 } If you want to modify these, you can pass pool as an options when instantiating Sequelize, as shown above. Note: Read replication only works for MySQL at the moment! Dialects With the release of Sequelize 1.6.0 , the library got independent from specific dialects. This means, that you'll have to add the respective connector library to your project yourself. Version 1.7.0 stable has been released in bundles with the connector libraries (sequelize-mysql, sequelize-postgres etc.) but these bundles are not maintained, and will not be released for 2.0.0 upwards. MySQL In order to get Sequelize working nicely together with MySQL, you'll need to install mysql@~2.5.0 or higher. Once that's done you can use it like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // mysql is the default dialect, but you know... // for demo purposes we are defining it nevertheless :) // so: we want mysql! dialect: 'mysql' }) Note: You can pass options directly to dialect library by setting the dialectOptions parameter. See Options for examples (currently only mysql and mariadb are supported). MariaDB For MariaDB compatibility you have to install the package mariasql@~0.1.20 . The configuration needs to look like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { dialect: 'mariadb' }) SQLite For SQLite compatibility you'll need sqlite3@~3.0.0 . Configure Sequelize like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // sqlite! now! dialect: 'sqlite', // the storage engine for sqlite // - default ':memory:' storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite' }) PostgreSQL The library for PostgreSQL is pg@~3.6.0 You'll just need to define the dialect: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // gimme postgres, please! dialect: 'postgres' }) MSSQL The library for MSSQL is tedious@^1.7.0 You'll just need to define the dialect: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { dialect: 'mssql' }) Executing raw SQL queries As there are often use cases in which it is just easier to execute raw / already prepared SQL queries, you can utilize the function sequelize.query . Here is how it works: // Arguments for raw queries sequelize.query('your query', [, options]) // Quick example sequelize.query(\"SELECT * FROM myTable\").then(function(myTableRows) { console.log(myTableRows) }) // If you want to return sequelize instances use the model options. // This allows you to easily map a query to a predefined model for sequelize e.g: sequelize .query('SELECT * FROM projects', { model: Projects }) .then(function(projects){ // Each record will now be mapped to the project's model. console.log(projects) }) // Options is an object with the following keys: sequelize .query('SELECT 1', { // A function (or false) for logging your queries // Will get called for every SQL query that gets send // to the server. logging: console.log, // If plain is true, then sequelize will only return the first // record of the result set. In case of false it will all records. plain: false, // Set this to true if you don't have a model definition for your query. raw: false }) // Note the second argument being null! // Even if we declared a callee here, the raw: true would // supersede and return a raw object. sequelize .query('SELECT * FROM projects', { raw: true }) .then(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) Replacements in a query can be done in two different ways, either using named parameters (starting with : ), or unnamed, represented by a ? The syntax used depends on the replacements option passed to the function: If an array is passed, ? will be replaced in the order that they appear in the array If an object is passed, :key will be replaced with the keys from that object. If the object contains keys not found in the query or vice versa, an exception will be thrown. sequelize .query( 'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = ?', { raw: true, replacements: ['active'] ) .then(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) sequelize .query( 'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = :status ', { raw: true, replacements: { status: 'active' } } ) .then(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) One note: If the attribute names of the table contain dots, the resulting objects will be nested: sequelize.query('select 1 as `foo.bar.baz`').then(function(rows) { console.log(JSON.stringify(rows)) /* [{ \"foo\": { \"bar\": { \"baz\": 1 } } }] */ })","title":"Usage"},{"location":"docs/usage/#basic-usage","text":"To get the ball rollin' you first have to create an instance of Sequelize.
