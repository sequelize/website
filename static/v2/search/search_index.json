All associations use CASCADE on update and SET NULL on delete, except for n:m, which also uses CASCADE on delete. When creating associations, you can provide an alias, via the as option. This is usefull if the same model is associated twice, or you want your association to be called something other than the name of the target model. As an example, consider the case where users have many pictures, one of which is their profile picture. All pictures have a userId , but in addition the user model also has a profilePictureId , to be able to easily load the user's profile picture. User.hasMany(Picture) User.belongsTo(Picture, { as: 'ProfilePicture', constraints: false }) user.getPictures() // gets you all pictures user.getProfilePicture() // gets you only the profile picture User.findAll({ where: ..., include: [ { model: Picture }, // load all pictures { model: Picture, as: 'ProfilePicture' }, // load the profile picture. Notice that the spelling must be the exact same as the one in the association ] }) To get full control over the foreign key column added by sequelize, you can use the foreignKey option. It can either be a string, that specifies the name, or and object type definition, equivalent to those passed to sequelize.define . User.hasMany(Picture, { foreignKey: 'uid' }) The foreign key column in Picture will now be called uid instead of the default userId . User.hasMany(Picture, { foreignKey: { name: 'uid' allowNull: false } }) This specifies that the uid column can not be null. In most cases this will already be covered by the foreign key costraints, which sequelize creates automatically, but can be usefull in case where the foreign keys are disabled, e.g. due to circular references (see constraints: false below). When fetching associated models, you can limit your query to only load some models. These queries are written in the same way as queries to find / findAll . To only get pictures in JPG, you can do: user.getPictures({ where: { format: 'jpg' } }) There are several ways to update and add new assoications. Continuing with our example of users and pictures: user.addPicture(p) // Add a single picture user.setPictures([p1, p2]) // Associate user with ONLY these two picture, all other associations will be deleted user.addPictures([p1, p2]) // Associate user with these two pictures, but don't touch any current associations You don't have to pass in a complete object to the association functions, if your associated model has a single primary key: user.addPicture(req.query.pid) // Here pid is just an integer, representing the primary key of the picture In the example above we have specified that a user belongs to his profile picture. Conceptually, this might not make sense, but since we want to add the foreign key to the user model this is the way to do it. Note how we also specified constraints: false for profile picture. This is because we add a foreign key from user to picture (profilePictureId), and from picture to user (userId). If we were to add foreign keys to both, it would create a cyclic dependency, and sequelize would not know which table to create first, since user depends on picture, and picture depends on user. These kinds of problems are detected by sequelize before the models are synced to the database, and you will get an error along the lines of Error: Cyclic dependency found. 'users' is dependent of itself . If you encounter this, you should either disable some constraints, or rethink your associations completely. hasOne(target, [options]) View code Creates an association between this (the source) and the provided target. The foreign key is added on the target. Example: User.hasOne(Profile) . This will add userId to the profile table. The following methods are injected on the source: get[AS] - for example getProfile(finder). The finder object is passed to target.find . set[AS] - for example setProfile(instance, options). Options are passed to target.save create[AS] - for example createProfile(value, options). Builds and saves a new instance of the associated model. Values and options are passed on to target.create All methods return a promise Params: Name Type Description target Model [options] object [options.hooks=false] boolean Set to true to run before-/afterDestroy hooks when an associated model is deleted because of a cascade. For example if User.hasOne(Profile, {onDelete: 'cascade', hooks:true}) , the before-/afterDestroy hooks for profile will be called when a user is deleted. Otherwise the profile will be deleted without invoking any hooks [options.as] string The alias of this model, in singular form. See also the name option passed to sequelize.define . If you create multiple associations between the same tables, you should provide an alias to be able to distinguish between them. If you provide an alias when creating the assocition, you should provide the same alias when eager loading and when getting assocated models. Defaults to the singularized name of target [options.foreignKey] string | object The name of the foreign key in the target table or an object representing the type definition for the foreign column (see Sequelize.define for syntax). When using an object, you can add a name property to set the name of the colum. Defaults to the name of source + primary key of source [options.onDelete='SET NULL'] string [options.onUpdate='CASCADE'] string [options.constraints=true] boolean Should on update and on delete constraints be enabled on the foreign key. belongsTo(target, [options]) View code Creates an association between this (the source) and the provided target. The foreign key is added on the source. Example: Profile.belongsTo(User) . This will add userId to the profile table. The following methods are injected on the source: get[AS] - for example getUser(finder). The finder object is passed to target.find . set[AS] - for example setUser(instance, options).

Defaults to the name of target + primary key of target [options.onDelete='SET NULL'] string [options.onUpdate='CASCADE'] string [options.constraints=true] boolean Should on update and on delete constraints be enabled on the foreign key. hasMany(target, [options]) View code Create an association that is either 1:m or n:m. // Create a 1:m association between user and project User.hasMany(Project) // Create a n:m association between user and project User.hasMany(Project) Project.hasMany(User) By default, the name of the join table will be source+target, so in this case projectsusers. This can be overridden by providing either a string or a Model as through in the options. The following methods are injected on the source: get[AS] - for example getPictures(finder). The finder object is passed to target.find . set[AS] - for example setPictures(instances, defaultAttributes|options). Update the associations. All currently associated models that are not in instances will be removed. add[AS] - for example addPicture(instance, defaultAttributes|options). Add another associated object. add[AS] [plural] - for example addPictures([instance1, instance2], defaultAttributes|options). Add some more associated objects. create[AS] - for example createPicture(values, options). Build and save a new association. remove[AS] - for example removePicture(instance). Remove a single association. remove[AS] [plural] - for example removePictures(instance). Remove multiple association. has[AS] - for example hasPicture(instance). Is source associated to this target? has[AS] [plural] - for example hasPictures(instances). Is source associated to all these targets? All methods return a promise If you use a through model with custom attributes, these attributes can be set when adding / setting new associations in two ways. Consider users and projects from before with a join table that stores whether the project has been started yet: var UserProjects = sequelize.define('userprojects', { started: Sequelize.BOOLEAN }) User.hasMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.hasMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) jan.addProject(homework, { started: false }) // The homework project is not started yet jan.setProjects([makedinner, doshopping], { started: true}) // Both shopping and dinner has been started If you want to set several target instances, but with different attributes you have to set the attributes on the instance, using a property with the name of the through model: p1.userprojects { started: true } user.setProjects([p1, p2], {started: false}) // The default value is false, but p1 overrides that. Similarily, when fetching through a join table with custom attributes, these attributes will be available as an object with the name of the through model. user.getProjects().success(function (projects) { var p1 = projects[0] p1.userprojects.started // Is this project started yet? }) Params: Name Type Description target Model [options] object [options.hooks=false] boolean Set to true to run before-/afterDestroy hooks when an associated model is deleted because of a cascade.

Otherwise the profile will be deleted without invoking any hooks [options.through] Model | string object [options.through.model] Model The model used to join both sides of the N:M association. [options.through.scope] object A key/value set that will be used for association create and find defaults on the through model.

You might see it referred to as both Instance and instance. You should not instantiate the Instance class directly, instead you access it using the finder and creation methods on the model. Instance instances operate with the concept of a dataValues property, which stores the actual values represented by the instance. By default, the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the Instance, that is: instance.field // is the same as instance.get('field') // is the same as instance.getDataValue('field') However, if getters and/or setters are defined for field they will be invoked, instead of returning the value from dataValues . Accessing properties directly or using get is preferred for regular use, getDataValue should only be used for custom getters.

Params: Name Type Description [key] String [options] Object [options.plain=false] Boolean If set to true, included instances will be returned as plain objects set(key, value, [options]) View code Set is used to update values on the instance (the sequelize representation of the instance that is, remember that nothing will be persisted before you actually call save ). In its most basic form set will update a value stored in the underlying dataValues object. However, if a custom setter function is defined for the key, that function will be called instead. To bypass the setter, you can pass raw: true in the options object. If set is called with an object, it will loop over the object, and call set recursively for each key, value pair. If you set raw to true, the underlying dataValues will either be set directly to the object passed, or used to extend dataValues, if dataValues already contain values. When set is called, the previous value of the field is stored, so that you can later see which fields changed (see changed ). Set can also be used to build instances for associations, if you have values for those. TODO - mick should probably write something here about how includes in set works - perhaps also even some tests?

If you set raw to true, the underlying dataValues will either be set directly to the object passed, or used to extend dataValues, if dataValues already contain values. When set is called, the previous value of the field is stored, so that you can later see which fields changed (see changed ). Set can also be used to build instances for associations, if you have values for those. TODO - mick should probably write something here about how includes in set works - perhaps also even some tests?

A minimal express application In order to create a minimal express application, we need to install express first and scaffold a project. We can do this via the following commands: $ mkdir example-app $ cd example-app $ npm install express express-generator $ node_modules/.bin/express . -f $ npm install $ ./bin/www You should now be able to see a tiny welcome page on http://localhost:3000 Adding Sequelize to the application Now that we have the express application in place, we can start adding Sequelize to it. What we need for that are the following packages: sequelize, sequelize-cli, sqlite3. Please note, that for the sake of simplicity this tutorial will use SQLite. $ npm install --save sequelize@2.0.0-rc1 sequelize-cli sqlite3 This will install the respective packages and uses the upcoming major release of sequelize. We can now let the sequelize CLI initialize the project's directory: $ node_modules/.bin/sequelize init Running this command will create the folders config , migrations and models . Implementing a todo app As an example application we will create a very basic and simple todo tool, which allows the creation of users and the management of their tasks. bin/www In order to create a maintainable application, we will put all the database logic into the models folder. When the application gets fired up, sequelize will sync the models with the database and afterwards start the server. This way we don't clutter the application while making use of sequelize's features. $(function () { fromGithub(\"bin_www\") }) models/index.js This file has been generated with the sequelize CLI and collects all the models from the models directory and associates them if needed. $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_index\", '.js') }) models/user.js All models of our application are located as separate files in the models folder. If you want to add a new model, just add it to this folder and everything will work automagically. Also you can use the sequelize CLI's sequelize model:create . Notice that the associate method receives a parameter models , which contains every declared model within the models directory. $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_user\", '.js') }) models/task.js The other needed model is Task . It relates to the User . $(function () { fromGithub(\"models_task\", '.js') }) routes/index.js The file routes/index.js contains the logic for a request against the main homepage. It loads the models module and uses it to load all the users and tasks from the database. $(function () { fromGithub(\"routes_index\", '.js') }) This will allow us to iterate over the users in the view file. We will skip the rest of the route files for this article. views/index.jade As we passed the users to the view and include the tasks for each user, we can access the data in the view's template file. Besides listing the users and tasks, there are also forms for creating new instances. $(function () { fromGithub(\"views_index\", '.jade') }) What's next? This article shows a basic approach of how to integrate Sequelize into an ExpressJS application. It allows the very easy management of models by adding new files to a specific folder. Starting the application will automatically sync the schema with the database. If you don't want to have automatic schema synchronization and instead want migrations, just add a respective step to your deployment script. When you use the CLI for the model generation, you will gain the migration scripts for free as well. You can find the complete application code on Github . Feel free to add pull requests to it.

You will learn how to use the supported dialects, which ways of database setup approaches are available and how common scenarios can be achieved. Premise We will skip the very basic things and directly dive into the Sequelize related stuff. Here is a list of things that have to be in place before you can start: Node.JS at v0.8 or higher One of the supported databases / SQLite bindings The credentials for the respective database A basic understanding of how databases are working Optional but recommended: Coffee :) A word about promises TODO - a link to bluebird + general promise syntax + catch / error handling Setting up a project Now that your computer is prepared and your coffee sits next to your keyboard, we can finally get started. First things first: Create a directory and initializeit with NPM! $ mkdir my-project $ cd my-project $ npm init NPM will ask you a couple of questions. Answer them or just hit the return key until it's satisfied. Once done, you can install Sequelize and the connector for your database of choice. $ npm install --save sequelize $ npm install --save pg # for postgres $ npm install --save mysql # for mysql $ npm install --save sqlite3 # for sqlite $ npm install --save mariasql # for mariasql Connecting to the database Open the created directory in your favorite text editor and add a new file called app.js with the following content. var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'username', 'password', { dialect: \"mysql\", // or 'sqlite', 'postgres', 'mariadb' port: 3306, // or 5432 (for postgres) }); sequelize .authenticate() .then(function(err) { console.log('Connection has been established successfully.'); }, function (err) { console.log('Unable to connect to the database:', err); }); Managing the schema of your database Sequelize supports two way of schema management. You can either define so called migrations, which are programmatically changing your database's structure. Or you can let Sequelize create the tables for you. While the first possibility of using migrations takes more time to setup, it's most likely the way to go, if you want to deploy your application on many different server environments. The reason for that is based on the fact, that migrations are consistently changing your database according to the current state of the schema. However, the automated way of using Sequelize's function sequelize.sync will probably be a good choice on your local machine or if you just want to quickly spin up a prototype. As this article is for beginners, we will skip migrations for now and take a closer look at the automated way. Defining a model In order to let Sequelize create a schemas in the database, you need to describe, what kind of data you want to store. This can be done with sequelize.define : var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }); This will define a user model that has a username and password. Furthermore, Sequelize will automatically add the columns id , createdAt and updatedAt . createdAt and updatedAt are controlled by sequelize - when you create a model through sequelize createdAt will be set, and whenever you call updateAttributes / save on a model, updatedAt will be set. Synchronizing the schema As we want to store data in the database, we need to create a representation of the model. sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function(err) { console.log('It worked!'); }, function (err) { console.log('An error occurred while creating the table:', err); }); Once executed, the database will contain a table Users (note the plural) with the columns: id - INT(11) username - VARCHAR(255) password - VARCHAR(255) createdAt - DATETIME updatedAt - DATETIME Please note, that { force: true } will drop the Users table and re-create it. Configuration You might not need the timestamps or you might not want the plural of the model's name as table name, right? Luckily there are configuration possibilities for that. var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { tableName: 'my_user_table', // this will define the table's name timestamps: false // this will deactivate the timestamp columns }) And just in case you want to customize the timestamp field names, you can do it like this: var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { updatedAt: 'last_update', createdAt: 'date_of_creation' }) Furthermore you can introduce a deletedAt timestamp so models are not actually deleted when you call destroy . Adding a deletedAt timestamp is called making the model 'paranoid': var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }, { paranoid: true }); Creating and persisting instances Sequelize allows the creation of instances in two ways. You can either build an object and save it afterwards. Or you can directly create an instance in the database: var user = User.build({ username: 'john-doe', password: generatePasswordHash('i-am-so-great') }) user.save().then(function() { /* ... */ }) This persists the instance in a two step way. If you want to do everything at once, use the following approach: User.create({ username: 'john-doe', password: generatePasswordHash('i-am-so-great') }).then(function(user) { /* ... */ }) Reading data from the database Every defined model has finder methods, with which you can read the database. Searching for a single item can be done with Model.find . Retrieval of multiple items needs the use of Model.findAll . User .find({ where: { username: 'john-doe' } }) .then(function(err, johnDoe) { if (!johnDoe) { console.log('No user with the username \"john-doe\" has been found.'); } else { console.log('Hello ' + johnDoe.username + '!'); console.log('All attributes of john:', johnDoe.get()); } }); Please note that there won't be any error if no user with the name \"john-doe\" has been found. This is intended, as there is not internal or authentication error. Defining associations A very common use case is the definition of associations between two or even more models. Once declared, Sequelize will know how to query the database to get or set associated data. Furthermore it will be able to automatically create the respective foreign key columns for you. Before taking a closer look at the code, it is critical to understand some details about the three different association types. One to one An association between one source and one target is called \"one to one\" or 1:1 association. It consists of a source that has one target and a target that belongs to a source. Sequelize expects a foreign key in the target's schema. That means that there has to be an attribute respectively a column in the target's table. var Source = sequelize.define('Source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('Target', {}) Source.hasOne(Target) Target.belongsTo(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // instances of Target will have a column SourceId! }); One to many An association between one source and many target is called \"one to many\" or 1:N association. It consists of a source that has many targets and some targets which belong to a source. Sequelize expects a foreign key in the target's schema. That means that there has to be an attribute respectively a column in the target's table. var Source = sequelize.define('Source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('Target', {}) Source.hasMany(Target) Target.belongsTo(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // instances of Target will have a column SourceId! }) Many to many An association between many sources and many targets is called \"many to many\" or N:M association. It consists of sources which have many targets and some targets which have many sources. Sequelize expects a junction table which contains a foreign key to the source table and a foreign key to the target table. A row in the table connects a source with a target. var Source = sequelize.define('Source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('Target', {}) Source.hasMany(Target) Target.hasMany(Source) sequelize .sync({ force: true }) .then(function() { // Even if we didn't define any foreign key or something else, // Sequelize will create a table SourcesTargets. }) Getting/Setting associations Defining associations is nice, but won't give you any advantage if you cannot read or set associations. Of course Sequelize will add respective functions to your models. Depending on the type of association you will find different methods: var Source = sequelize.define('Source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('Target', {}); Source.hasOne(Target); Target.belongsTo(Source); sequelize.Promise.all([ Source.create({}), Target.create({}) ]).spread(function (source, target) { // Set the association return source.setTarget(target).return(source); }).then(function(source) { // Get the association return source.getTarget(); }).then(function(_target) { console.log(_target.values) /* { id: 1, createdAt: Sun Dec 08 2013 11:46:42 GMT+0100 (CET), updatedAt: Sun Dec 08 2013 11:46:42 GMT+0100 (CET), SourceId: 1 } */ }); Clearing associations Assuming we already defined the models (as in the previous code example) and synced the schema with the database, we can clear the associations like this: source.setTarget(null).then(function() { return source.getTarget(); }).then(function(target) { console.log(target); }); Adding / removing associations For 1:N and N:M associations it makes sense to not only set the associations, but also to add or remove associations. Furthermore checking for an association can be handy. var Source = sequelize.define('Source', {}) , Target = sequelize.define('Target', {}); Source.hasMany(Target); Target.belongsTo(Source); return sequelize.Promise.all([ Source.create({}), Target.create({}); Target.create({}), ]).bind({}).spread(function (source, target1, target2) { // Set the association this.source = source; this.target1 = target1; this.target2 = target2; return source.setTargets([target1, target2]); }).then(function() { // Get the association return this.source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 2 // Remove an association return this.source.removeTarget(this.target1); }).then(function() { return source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 1 // Check for an association return this.source.hasTarget(this.target1); }).then(function(hasTarget) { console.log(hasTarget) // false // Adding an association return this.source.addTarget(this.target1); }).then(function() { return this.source.getTargets(); }).then(function(targets) { console.log(targets.length) // = 2 return this.source.hasTarget(this.target1); }).then(function(hasTarget) { console.log(hasTarget) // true }); A combined example Now that you know the basics of Sequelize, you might want to see everything in a single program. var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'username', 'password') , User = sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING, password: Sequelize.STRING }); sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(function() { return User.create({ username: 'john', password: '1111' }); }).then(function(user1) { return User.find({ username: 'john' }) }).then(function(user2) { console.log(user2.get()); // Get returns a JSON representation of the user }); What's next?

It will explain how to get started with Heroku and what is necessary to setup a proper environment. We will use MySQL on the development machine and PostgreSQL on the remote servers. Getting started with Heroku Before we can roll out any software on the Heroku cluster, we need to sign up and have to connect our development environment. Here are the most basic steps: Sign up for a Heroku account. Install the Heroku Toolbelt. This tool will let you create applications and is a handy way to configure them on the command line. Use the new binary to login. Run the following command on command line: heroku login And that's it. You should now be able to do things like heroku apps . This should list all applications you've currently created on the Heroku cluster. If you've just created a new account, this should show you an empty list. You can get further information about the registration process here . A minimal express application In order to create a minimal express application, we need to install express first. We can do this via the following commands: $ mkdir example-app $ cd example-app $ npm install express $ node_modules/.bin/express . -f $ npm install $ node app.js So now we have a default express application. If you point your browser to http://localhost:8080 , you will see a tiny page welcoming you. Next step: Deploy the application to Heroku. Deployment to Heroku First of all, we need to add the right version of Node.JS and NPM to the package.json . The file should look similiar to this: { \"name\": \"application-name\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"private\": true, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"node app.js\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"express\": \"3.1.1\", \"jade\": \"*\" }, \"engines\": { \"node\": \"0.8.x\", \"npm\": \"1.1.x\" } } Now we can create a Heroku application and deploy to it: $ echo \"web: node app.js\" > Procfile $ echo \"node_modules\" > .gitignore $ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m \"initial commit\" $ heroku create $ git push heroku master $ heroku ps:scale web=1 $ heroku open You should now see a browser with the same application as on your local machine. Spawning a database on Heroku In order to get a database on Heroku we can use their CLI. Just run the following command and take a closer look at it's output: $ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev This will result in something like this: Adding heroku-postgresql:dev on fast-dusk-7858... done, v5 (free) Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL Database has been created and is available ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer ! data from another database with pgbackups:restore. Use `heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql:dev` to view documentation. What we will need is the color (sounds strange right?) of the database. In this case we just created a bronze one. That means, that we will have an environment variable HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL containing the URI of the database. If you are interested in the URI, you can just run this command: $ heroku config:get HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL $ # => postgres://pfforbjhkrletg:aic5oO6Cran1g3hk6mJa5QqNZB@ec2-23-21-91-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dek11b2j1g3mfb Adding Sequelize to the application The following commands will install sequelize , the needed PostgreSQL library as well as the MySQL bindings. Also we will create a folder models , that will contain the model definitions. $ npm install --save sequelize pg mysql $ mkdir models app.js In order to create a maintainable application, we will put all the database logic into the models folder. The application's main file will then just sync the models with the database and run the server. This way we don't clutter the application. var express = require('express') , routes = require('./routes') , user = require('./routes/user') , http = require('http') , path = require('path') , db = require('./models'); var app = express(); // all environments app.set('port', process.env.PORT || 3000); app.set('views', __dirname + '/views'); app.set('view engine', 'jade'); app.use(express.favicon()); app.use(express.logger('dev')); app.use(express.bodyParser()); app.use(express.methodOverride()); app.use(app.router); app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // development only if ('development' === app.get('env')) { app.use(express.errorHandler()); } app.get('/', routes.index); app.get('/users', user.list); db.sequelize.sync().then(function() { http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){ console.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port')); }); }); models/index.js The idea of this file is to configure a connection to the database and to collect all model definitions. Once everything is in place we will store the stuff in a singleton. This will make it possible to load the file whenever we need database access without running into issues with duplicated database access. This file will also differ between the local machine and the Heroku server. if (!global.hasOwnProperty('db')) { var Sequelize = require('sequelize') , sequelize = null if (process.env.HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL) { // the application is executed on Heroku ... use the postgres database sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BRONZE_URL, { dialect: 'postgres', protocol: 'postgres', port: match[4], host: match[3], logging: true //false }) } else { // the application is executed on the local machine ... use mysql sequelize = new Sequelize('example-app-db', 'root', null) } global.db = { Sequelize: Sequelize, sequelize: sequelize, User: sequelize.import(__dirname + '/user') // add your other models here } /* Associations can be defined here. E.g. like this: global.db.User.hasMany(global.db.SomethingElse) */ } module.exports = global.db models/user.js All the other models of our application will be located as separate files in the models folder. We will use the import -method of Sequelize to load those files. module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"User\", { username: DataTypes.STRING }) } Running Migrations To run migrations on Heroku you must have the following entry in your config/config.json file: \"production\": { \"use_env_variable\": \"DATABASE_URL\" } Which also means you must make sure your Heroku environment has a promoted database.

Doing so will help you to easily access and set those associated objects. The library therefore provides for each defined class different methods, which are explained in the following chapters. Note: Associations with models that use custom primaryKeys (so not the field 'id') are currently unsupported. One-To-One associations One-To-One associations are connecting one source with exactly one target. In order to define a proper database schema, Sequelize utilizes the methods belongsTo and hasOne . You can use them as follows: var User = sequelize.define('User', {/* ... */}) var Project = sequelize.define('Project', {/* ... */}) // One-way associations Project.hasOne(User) /* In this example hasOne will add an attribute ProjectId to the User model! Furthermore, Project.prototype will gain the methods getUser and setUser according to the first parameter passed to define. If you have underscore style enabled, the added attribute will be project_id instead of ProjectId. You can also define the foreign key, e.g. if you already have an existing database and want to work on it: */ Project.hasOne(User, { foreignKey: 'initiator_id' }) /* Because Sequelize will use the model's name (first parameter of define) for the accessor methods, it is also possible to pass a special option to hasOne: */ Project.hasOne(User, { as: 'Initiator' }) // Now you will get Project#getInitiator and Project#setInitiator // Or let's define some self references var Person = sequelize.define('Person', { /* ... */}) Person.hasOne(Person, {as: 'Father'}) // this will add the attribute FatherId to Person // also possible: Person.hasOne(Person, {as: 'Father', foreignKey: 'DadId'}) // this will add the attribute DadId to Person // In both cases you will be able to do: Person#setFather Person#getFather // If you need to join a table twice you can double join the same table Team .hasOne(Game, {foreignKey : 'homeTeamId'}); .hasOne(Game, {foreignKey : 'awayTeamId'}); Game .belongsTo(Team); // Since v1.3.0 you can also chain associations: Project .hasOne(User) .hasOne(Deadline) .hasOne(Attachment) To get the association working the other way around (so from User to Project ), it's necessary to do this: var User = sequelize.define('User', {/* ... */}) var Project = sequelize.define('Project', {/* ... */}) // One-way back associations Project.belongsTo(User) /* In this example belongsTo will add an attribute UserId to the Project model! That's the only difference to hasMany. Self references are working the very same way! */ One-To-Many associations One-To-Many associations are connecting one source with multiple targets. The targets however are again connected to exactly one specific source. var User = sequelize.define('User', {/* ... */}) var Project = sequelize.define('Project', {/* ... */}) // OK. Now things get more complicated (not really visible to the user :)). // First let's define a hasMany association Project.hasMany(User, {as: 'Workers'}) This will add the attribute ProjectId or project_id to User. Instances of Project will get the accessors getWorkers and setWorkers. We could just leave it the way it is and let it be a one-way association. But we want more! Let's define it the other way around by creating a many to many assocation in the next section: Many-To-Many associations Many-To-Many associations are used to connect sources with multiple targets. Furthermore the targets can also have connections to multiple sources. // again the Project association to User Project.hasMany(User) // now comes the association between User and Project User.hasMany(Project) This will remove the attribute ProjectId (or project_id ) from User and create a new model called ProjectsUsers with the equivalent foreign keys ProjectId (or project_id ) and UserId (or user_id ). Whether the attributes are camelcase or not depends on the two models joined by the table (in this case User and Project). This will add methods getUsers , setUsers , addUsers to Project , and getProjects , setProjects and addProject to User . Sometimes you may want to rename your models when using them in associations. Let's define users as workers and projects as tasks by using the alias ( as ) option: User.hasMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks' }) Project.hasMany(User, { as: 'Workers', through: 'worker_tasks' }) Notice how we used the through option together with the alias in the code above. This is needed to tell sequelize that the two hasMany calls are actually two sides of the same association. If you don't use an alias (as shown in the first example of this section) this matching happens automagically, but with aliassed assocations through is required. Of course you can also define self references with hasMany: Person.hasMany(Person, { as: 'Children' }) // This will create the table ChildrenPersons which stores the ids of the objects. // You can also reference the same Model without creating a junction // table (but only if each object will have just one 'parent'). If you need that, // use the option foreignKey and set through to null Comment.hasMany(Comment, { as: 'Children', foreignKey: 'ParentId', through: null }) By default, sequelize will handle everything related to the join table for you. However, sometimes you might want some more control over the table. This is where th e through options comes in handy. If you just want to control the name of the join table, you can pass a string: Project.hasMany(User, {through: 'project_has_users'}) User.hasMany(Project, {through: 'project_has_users'}) If you want additional attributes in your join table, you can define a model for the join table in sequelize, before you define the association, and then tell sequelize that it should use that model for joining, instead of creating a new one: User = sequelize.define('User', {}) Project = sequelize.define('Project', {}) UserProjects = sequelize.define('UserProjects', { status: DataTypes.STRING }) User.hasMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.hasMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) To add a new project to a user and set it's status, you pass an extra object to the setter, which contains the attributes for the join table user.addProject(project, { status: 'started' }) By default the code above will add ProjectId and UserId to the UserProjects table, and_remove any previsouly defined primary key attribute _- the table will be uniquely identified by the combination of the keys of the two tables, and there is no reason to have other PK columns. To enforce a primary key on the UserProjects model you can add it manually. UserProjects = sequelize.define('UserProjects', { id: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true }, status: DataTypes.STRING }) Naming strategy By default sequelize will use the model name (the name passed to sequelize.define ) to figure out the name of the model when used in associations. For example, a model named user will add the functions get/set/add User to instances of the associated model, and a property named .user in eager loading, while a model named User will add the same functions, but a property named .User (notice the upper case U) in eager loading. As we've already seen, you can alias models in associations using as . In single assocations (has one and belongs to), the alias should be singular, while for many associations (has many) it should be plural. Sequelize then uses the inflection library to convert the alias to its singular form. However, this might not always work for irregular or non-english words. In this case, you can provide both the plural and the singular form of the alias: User.hasMany(Project, { as: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks' }}) // Notice that inflection has no problem singularizing tasks, this is just for illustrative purposes. If you know that a model will always use the same alias in associations, you can provide it when creating the model var Project = sequelize.define('project', attributes, { name: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks', } }) User.hasMany(Project); This will add the functions add/set/get Tasks to user instances. Associating objects Because Sequelize is doing a lot of magic, you have to call Sequelize.sync after setting the associations! Doing so will allow you the following: Project.hasMany(Task) Task.hasMany(Project) Project.create()... Task.create()... Task.create()... // save them... and then: project.setTasks([task1, task2]).success(function() { // saved! }) // ok now they are save... how do I get them later on? project.getTasks().success(function(associatedTasks) { // associatedTasks is an array of tasks }) // You can also pass filters to the getter method. // They are equal to the options you can pass to a usual finder method. project.getTasks({ where: 'id > 10' }).success(function(tasks) { // tasks with an id greater than 10 :) }) // You can also only retrieve certain fields of a associated object. // This example will retrieve the attibutes \"title\" and \"id\" project.getTasks({attributes: ['title']}).success(function(tasks) { // tasks with an id greater than 10 :) }) To remove created associations you can just call the set method without a specific id: // remove the association with task1 project.setTasks([task2]).success(function(associatedTasks) { // you will get task2 only }) // remove 'em all project.setTasks([]).success(function(associatedTasks) { // you will get an empty array }) // or remove 'em more directly project.removeTask(task1).success(function() { // it's gone }) // and add 'em again project.addTask(task1).success(function() { // it's back again }) You can of course also do it vice versa: // project is associated with task1 and task2 task2.setProject(null).success(function() { // and it's gone }) For hasOne/belongsTo its basically the same: Task.hasOne(User, {as: \"Author\"}) Task#setAuthor(anAuthor) Adding associations to a relation with a custom join table can be done in two ways (continuing with the associations defined in the previous chapter): // Either by adding a property with the name of the join table model to the object, before creating the association project.UserProjects = { status: 'active' } u.addProject(project) // Or by providing a second argument when adding the association, containing the data that should go in the join table u.addProject(project, { status: 'active' }) // When associating multiple objects, you can combine the two options above. In this case the second argument // will be treated as a defaults object, that will be used if no data is provided project1.UserProjects = { status: 'inactive' } u.setProjects([project1, project2], { status: 'active' }) // The code above will record inactive for project one, and active for project two in the join table When getting data on an association that has a custom join table, the data from the join table will be returned as a DAO instance: u.getProjects().success(function(projects) { var project = projects[0] if (project.UserProjects.status === 'active') { // .. do magic // since this is a real DAO instance, you can save it directly after you are done doing magic project.UserProjects.save() } }) If you only need some of the attributes from the join table, you can provide an array with the attributes you want: // This will select only name from the Projects table, and only status from the UserProjects table user.getProjects({ attributes: ['name'], joinTableAttributes: ['status']}) Check associations You can also check if an object is already associated with another one (N:M only). Here is how you'd do it: // check if an object is one of associated ones: Project.create({ /* */ }).success(function(project) { User.create({ /* */ }).success(function(user) { project.hasUser(user).success(function(result) { // result would be false project.addUser(user).success(function() { project.hasUser(user).success(function(result) { // result would be true }) }) }) }) }) // check if all associated objects are as expected: // let's assume we have already a project and two users project.setUsers([user1, user2]).success(function() { project.hasUsers([user1]).success(function(result) { // result would be false project.hasUsers([user1, user2]).success(function(result) { // result would be true }) }) }) Foreign Keys When you create associations between your models in sequelize, foreign key references with constraints will automatically be created. The setup below: var Task = this.sequelize.define('Task', { title: Sequelize.STRING }) , User = this.sequelize.define('User', { username: Sequelize.STRING }) User.hasMany(Task) Task.belongsTo(User) Will generate the following SQL: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `User` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `username` VARCHAR(255) ); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Task` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `title` VARCHAR(255), `user_id` INTEGER REFERENCES `User` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE ); The relation between task and user injects the user_id foreign key on tasks, and marks it as a reference to the User table. By default user_id will be set to NULL if the referenced user is deleted, and updated if the id of the user id updated. These options can be overriden by passing onUpdate and onDelete options to the association calls. The validation options are RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT, SET NULL . For 1:1 and 1:m associations the default option is SET NULL for deletion, and CASCADE for updates. For n:m, the default for both is CASCADE . This means, that if you delete or update a row from one side of an n:m association, all the rows in the join table refrencing that row will also be deleted or updated. Adding constriants between tables means that tables must be created in the database in a certain order, when using sequelize.sync . If Task has a reference to User, the User table must be created before the Task table can be created. This can sometimes lead to circular references, where sequelize cannot find an order in which to sync. Imagine a scenario of documents and versions. A document can have multiple versions, and for convenience, a document has an reference to it's current version. var Document = this.sequelize.define('Document', { author: Sequelize.STRING }) , Version = this.sequelize.define('Version', { timestamp: Sequelize.DATE }) Document.hasMany(Version) // This adds document_id to version Document.belongsTo(Version, { as: 'Current', foreignKey: 'current_version_id'}) // This adds current_version_id to document However, the code above will result in the following error: Cyclic dependency found. 'Document' is dependent of itself. Dependency Chain: Document -> Version => Document . In order to alleviate that, we can pass constraints: false to one of the associations: Document.hasMany(Version) Document.belongsTo(Version, { as: 'Current', foreignKey: 'current_version_id', constraints: false}) Which will allow us to sync the tables correctly: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Document` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `author` VARCHAR(255), `current_version_id` INTEGER ); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Version` ( `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, `timestamp` DATETIME, `document_id` INTEGER REFERENCES `Document` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE ); Enforcing a foreign key reference without constraints Some times you may want to reference another table, without adding any constraints, or associations. In that case you can manually add the reference attributes to your schema definition, and mark the relations between them. var Series, Trainer, Video // Series has a trainer_id=Trainer.id foreign reference key after we call Trainer.hasMany(series) Series = sequelize.define('Series', { title: DataTypes.STRING, sub_title: DataTypes.STRING, description: DataTypes.TEXT, // Set FK relationship (hasMany) with `Trainer` trainer_id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, references: \"Trainer\", referencesKey: \"id\" } }) Trainer = sequelize.define('Trainer', { first_name: DataTypes.STRING, last_name: DataTypes.STRING }); // Video has a series_id=Series.id foreign reference key after we call Series.hasOne(Video)...

Furthermore the targets can also have connections to multiple sources. // again the Project association to User Project.hasMany(User) // now comes the association between User and Project User.hasMany(Project) This will remove the attribute ProjectId (or project_id ) from User and create a new model called ProjectsUsers with the equivalent foreign keys ProjectId (or project_id ) and UserId (or user_id ). Whether the attributes are camelcase or not depends on the two models joined by the table (in this case User and Project). This will add methods getUsers , setUsers , addUsers to Project , and getProjects , setProjects and addProject to User . Sometimes you may want to rename your models when using them in associations. Let's define users as workers and projects as tasks by using the alias ( as ) option: User.hasMany(Project, { as: 'Tasks', through: 'worker_tasks' }) Project.hasMany(User, { as: 'Workers', through: 'worker_tasks' }) Notice how we used the through option together with the alias in the code above. This is needed to tell sequelize that the two hasMany calls are actually two sides of the same association. If you don't use an alias (as shown in the first example of this section) this matching happens automagically, but with aliassed assocations through is required. Of course you can also define self references with hasMany: Person.hasMany(Person, { as: 'Children' }) // This will create the table ChildrenPersons which stores the ids of the objects. // You can also reference the same Model without creating a junction // table (but only if each object will have just one 'parent'). If you need that, // use the option foreignKey and set through to null Comment.hasMany(Comment, { as: 'Children', foreignKey: 'ParentId', through: null }) By default, sequelize will handle everything related to the join table for you. However, sometimes you might want some more control over the table. This is where th e through options comes in handy. If you just want to control the name of the join table, you can pass a string: Project.hasMany(User, {through: 'project_has_users'}) User.hasMany(Project, {through: 'project_has_users'}) If you want additional attributes in your join table, you can define a model for the join table in sequelize, before you define the association, and then tell sequelize that it should use that model for joining, instead of creating a new one: User = sequelize.define('User', {}) Project = sequelize.define('Project', {}) UserProjects = sequelize.define('UserProjects', { status: DataTypes.STRING }) User.hasMany(Project, { through: UserProjects }) Project.hasMany(User, { through: UserProjects }) To add a new project to a user and set it's status, you pass an extra object to the setter, which contains the attributes for the join table user.addProject(project, { status: 'started' }) By default the code above will add ProjectId and UserId to the UserProjects table, and_remove any previsouly defined primary key attribute _- the table will be uniquely identified by the combination of the keys of the two tables, and there is no reason to have other PK columns.

For example, a model named user will add the functions get/set/add User to instances of the associated model, and a property named .user in eager loading, while a model named User will add the same functions, but a property named .User (notice the upper case U) in eager loading. As we've already seen, you can alias models in associations using as . In single assocations (has one and belongs to), the alias should be singular, while for many associations (has many) it should be plural. Sequelize then uses the inflection library to convert the alias to its singular form. However, this might not always work for irregular or non-english words. In this case, you can provide both the plural and the singular form of the alias: User.hasMany(Project, { as: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks' }}) // Notice that inflection has no problem singularizing tasks, this is just for illustrative purposes. If you know that a model will always use the same alias in associations, you can provide it when creating the model var Project = sequelize.define('project', attributes, { name: { singular: 'task', plural: 'tasks', } }) User.hasMany(Project); This will add the functions add/set/get Tasks to user instances.","title":"Naming strategy"},{"location":"docs/associations/#associating-objects","text":"Because Sequelize is doing a lot of magic, you have to call Sequelize.sync after setting the associations!

By default user_id will be set to NULL if the referenced user is deleted, and updated if the id of the user id updated. These options can be overriden by passing onUpdate and onDelete options to the association calls. The validation options are RESTRICT, CASCADE, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT, SET NULL . For 1:1 and 1:m associations the default option is SET NULL for deletion, and CASCADE for updates. For n:m, the default for both is CASCADE . This means, that if you delete or update a row from one side of an n:m association, all the rows in the join table refrencing that row will also be deleted or updated. Adding constriants between tables means that tables must be created in the database in a certain order, when using sequelize.sync . If Task has a reference to User, the User table must be created before the Task table can be created. This can sometimes lead to circular references, where sequelize cannot find an order in which to sync. Imagine a scenario of documents and versions.

A hook function always runs asynchronous\u013ay, and can be resolved either by calling a callback (passed as the last argument), or by returning a promise. // Method 1 via the .define() method var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: DataTypes.STRING, mood: { type: DataTypes.ENUM, values: ['happy', 'sad', 'neutral'] } }, { hooks: { beforeValidate: function(user, fn) { user.mood = 'happy' fn(null, user) }, afterValidate: function(user, fn) { user.username = 'Toni' fn(null, user) } } }) // Method 2 via the .hook() method var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: DataTypes.STRING, mood: { type: DataTypes.ENUM, values: ['happy', 'sad', 'neutral'] } }) User.hook('beforeValidate', function(user, fn) { user.mood = 'happy' fn(null, user) }) User.hook('afterValidate', function(user) { return sequelize.Promise.reject(\"I'm afraid I can't let you do that!\") }) // Method 3 via the direct method var User = sequelize.define('User', { username: DataTypes.STRING, mood: { type: DataTypes.ENUM, values: ['happy', 'sad', 'neutral'] } }) User.beforeValidate(function(user) { user.mood = 'happy' return sequelize.Promise.resolve(user) }) User.afterValidate(function(user, fn) { user.username = 'Toni' fn(null, user) }) Instance hooks The following hooks will emit whenever you're editing a single object... beforeValidate afterValidate beforeCreate / beforeUpdate / beforeDestroy afterCreate / afterUpdate / afterDestroy // ...define ...

The following will emit whenever you're using one of those methods. beforeBulkCreate / beforeBulkUpdate / beforeBulkDestroy afterBulkCreate / afterBulkUpdate / afterBulkDestroy If you want to emit hooks for each individual record, along with the bulk hooks you can pass individualHooks: true to the call. Model.destroy({accessLevel: 0}, {individualHooks: true}) // Will select all records that are about to be deleted and emit before- + after- Destroy on each instance Model.update({username: 'Toni'}, {accessLevel: 0}, {individualHooks: true}) // Will select all records that are about to be updated and emit before- + after- Update on each instance Model.bulkCreate({accessLevel: 0}, null, {individualHooks: true}) // Will select all records that are about to be deleted and emit before- + after- Create on each instance Some model hooks have two or three parameters sent to each hook depending on it's type.

The only way to call beforeDestroy/afterDestroy hooks are on associations with onDelete: 'cascade' and the option hooks: true . For instance: var Projects = sequelize.define('Projects', { title: DataTypes.STRING }) var Tasks = sequelize.define('Tasks', { title: DataTypes.STRING }) Projects.hasMany(Tasks, {onDelete: 'cascade', hooks: true}) Tasks.belongsTo(Projects) This code will run beforeDestroy/afterDestroy on the Tasks table. Sequelize, by default, will try to optimize your queries as much as possible. When calling cascade on delete, Sequelize will simply execute a DELETE FROM `table` WHERE associatedIdentifiier = associatedIdentifier.primaryKey However, adding hooks: true explicitly tells Sequelize that optimization is not of your concern and will perform a SELECT on the associated objects and destroy each instance one by one in order to be able to call the hooks with the right parameters. A Note About Transactions Note that many model operations in Sequelize allow you to specify a transaction in the options parameter of the method. If a transaction is specified in the original call, it will be present in the options parameter passed to the hook function. For example, consider the following snippet: // Here we use the promise-style of async hooks rather than // the callback. User.hook('afterCreate', function(user, options) { // 'trans' will be available in options.transaction // This operation will be part of the same transaction as the // original User.create call. return User.update({ mood: 'sad' }, { where: { id: user.id }, transaction: options.transaction }); }); sequelize.transaction(function(trans) { User.create({ username: 'someguy', mood: 'happy' }, { transaction: trans }); }); If we had not included the transaction option in our call to User.update in the preceding code, no change would have occurred, since our newly created user does not exist in the database until the pending transaction has been committed. Internal Transactions It is very important to recognize that sequelize may make use of transactions internally for certain operations such as Model.findOrCreate . If your hook functions execute read or write operations that rely on the object's presence in the database, or modify the object's stored values like the example in the preceding section, you should always specify { transaction: options.transaction } . If the hook has been called in the process of a transacted operation, this makes sure that your dependent read/write is a part of that same transaction.

You might recognize the syntax if you coded Ruby in the past. Using the build -method will return an unsaved object, which you explicitly have to save. var project = Project.build({ title: 'my awesome project', description: 'woot woot. this will make me a rich man' }) var task = Task.build({ title: 'specify the project idea', description: 'bla', deadline: new Date() }) Built instances will automatically get default values when they were defined: // first define the model var Task = sequelize.define('Project', { title: Sequelize.STRING, rating: { type: Sequelize.STRING, defaultValue: 3 } }) // now instantiate an object var task = Task.build({title: 'very important task'}) task.title // ==> 'very important task' task.rating // ==> 3 To get it stored in the database, use the save -method and catch the events ... if needed: project.save().success(function() { // my nice callback stuff }) task.save().error(function(error) { // mhhh, wth! }) // you can also build, save and access the object with chaining: Task .build({ title: 'foo', description: 'bar', deadline: new Date() }) .save() .success(function(anotherTask) { // you can now access the currently saved task with the variable anotherTask... nice! }).error(function(error) { // Ooops, do some error-handling }) Creating persistant instances Besides constructing objects, that needs an explicit save call to get stored in the database, there is also the possibility to do all those steps with one single command. It's called create . Task.create({ title: 'foo', description: 'bar', deadline: new Date() }).success(function(task) { // you can now access the newly created task via the variable task }) It is also possible to define which attributes can be set via the create method. This can be especially very handy if you create database entries based on a form which can be filled by a user. Using that would for example allow you to restrict the User model to set only a username and an address but not an admin flag: User.create({ username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, [ 'username' ]).success(function(user) { // let's assume the default of isAdmin is false: console.log(user.values) // => { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: false } }) Updating / Saving / Persisting an instance Now lets change some values and save changes to the database... There are two ways to do that: // way 1 task.title = 'a very different title now' task.save().success(function() {}) // way 2 task.updateAttributes({ title: 'a very different title now' }).success(function() {}) It's also possible to define which attributes should be saved when calling save , by passing an array of column names. This is useful when you set attributes based on a previously defined object. E.g. if you get the values of an object via a form of a web app. Furthermore this is used internally for updateAttributes . This is how it looks like: task.title = 'foooo' task.description = 'baaaaaar' task.save(['title']).success(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) // The equivalent call using updateAttributes looks like this: task.updateAttributes({ title: 'foooo', description: 'baaaaaar'}, ['title']).success(function() { // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before }) Destroying / Deleting persistant instances Once you created an object and got a reference to it, you can delete it from the database. The relevant method is destroy : Task.create({ title: 'a task' }).success(function(task) { // now you see me... task.destroy().success(function() { // now i'm gone :) }) }) If the paranoid options is true, the object will not be deleted, instead the deletedAt column will be set to the current timestamp. To force the deletion, you can pass force: true to the destroy call: task.destroy({ force: true }) Working in bulk (creating, updating and destroying multiple rows at once) In addition to updating a single instance, you can also create, update, and delete multiple instances at once. The functions you are looking for are called Model.bulkCreate Model.update Model.destroy Since you are working with multiple models, the callbacks will not return DAO instances. BulkCreate will return an array of model instances/DAOs, they will however, unlike create , not have the resulting values of autoIncrement attributes. update and destroy will return the number of affected rows. First lets look at bulkCreate User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'barfooz', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'foo', isAdmin: true }, { username: 'bar', isAdmin: false } ]).success(function() { // Notice: There are no arguments here, as of right now you'll have to... User.findAll().success(function(users) { console.log(users) // ... in order to get the array of user objects }) }) To update several rows at once: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).success(function() { Task.update( {status: 'inactive'} /* set attributes' value */, {subject: 'programming'} /* where criteria */ ).success(function(affectedRows) { // affectedRows will be 2 Task.findAll().success(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // the 'programming' tasks will both have a status of 'inactive' }) }) }) And delete them: Task.bulkCreate([ {subject: 'programming', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'reading', status: 'executing'}, {subject: 'programming', status: 'finished'} ]).success(function() { Task.destroy( {subject: 'programming'} /* where criteria */, {truncate: true /* truncate the whole table, ignoring where criteria */} /* options */ ).success(function(affectedRows) { // affectedRows will be 2 Task.findAll().success(function(tasks) { console.log(tasks) // no programming, just reading :( }) }) }) If you are accepting values directly from the user, it might be beneficial to limit the columns that you want to actually insert. bulkCreate() accepts an options object as the second parameter. The object can have a fields parameter, (an array) to let it know which fields you want to build explicitly User.bulkCreate([ { username: 'foo' }, { username: 'bar', admin: true} ], { fields: ['username'] }).success(function() { // nope bar, you can't be admin! }) bulkCreate was originally made to be a mainstream/fast way of inserting records, however, sometimes you want the luxury of being able to insert multiple rows at once without sacrificing model validations even when you explicitly tell Sequelize which columns to sift through. You can do by adding a validate: true property to the optons object. var Tasks = sequelize.define('Task', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { notNull: { args: true, msg: 'name cannot be null' } } }, code: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { len: [3, 10] } } }) Tasks.bulkCreate([ {name: 'foo', code: '123'}, {code: '1234'}, {name: 'bar', code: '1'} ], { validate: true }).error(function(errors) { /* console.log(errors) would look like: [ { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } }, { record: ... errors: { name: 'SequelizeValidationError', message: 'Validation error', errors: [Object] } } ] */ }) Values of an instance If you log an instance you will notice, that there is a lot of additional stuff. In order to hide such stuff and reduce it to the very interesting information, you can use the values -attribute. Calling it will return only the values of an instance. Person.create({ name: 'Rambow', firstname: 'John' }).success(function(john) { console.log(john.values) }) // result: // { name: 'Rambow', // firstname: 'John', // id: 1, // createdAt: Tue, 01 May 2012 19:12:16 GMT, // updatedAt: Tue, 01 May 2012 19:12:16 GMT // } Hint: You can also transform an instance into JSON by using JSON.stringify(instance) . This will basically return the very same as values . Reloading instances If you need to get your instance in sync, you can use the method reload . It will fetch the current data from the database and overwrite the attributes of the model on which the method has been called on. Person.find({ where: { name: 'john' } }).success(function(person) { person.name = 'jane' console.log(person.name) // 'jane' person.reload().success(function() { console.log(person.name) // 'john' }) }) Incrementing certain values of an instance In order to increment values of an instance without running into concurrency issues, you may use increment . First of all you can define a field and the value you want to add to it. User.find(1).success(function(user) { user.increment('my-integer-field', 2).success(/* ... */) }) Second, you can define multiple fields and the value you want to add to them. User.find(1).success(function(user) { user.increment([ 'my-integer-field', 'my-very-other-field' ], 2).success(/* ... */) }) Third, you can define an object containing fields and its increment values. User.find(1).success(function(user) { user.increment({ 'my-integer-field': 2, 'my-very-other-field': 3 }).success(/* ... */) }) Decrementing certain values of an instance In order to decrement values of an instance without running into concurrency issues, you may use decrement . First of all you can define a field and the value you want to add to it. User.find(1).success(function(user) { user.decrement('my-integer-field', 2).success(/* ... */) }) Second, you can define multiple fields and the value you want to add to them. User.find(1).success(function(user) { user.decrement([ 'my-integer-field', 'my-very-other-field' ], 2).success(/* ... */) }) Third, you can define an object containing fields and its decrement values.

The CLI ships support for migrations and project bootstrapping. With migrations you can transfer your existing database into another state and vice versa: Those state transitions are saved in migration files, which describe the way how to get to the new state and how to revert the changes in order to get back to the old state. The CLI In order to use the CLI you need to install the respective package: $ npm install --save sequelize-cli The CLI currently supports the following commands: $ sequelize db:migrate # Run pending migrations. $ sequelize db:migrate:undo # Revert the last migration run. $ sequelize help # Display this help text. $ sequelize init # Initializes the project. $ sequelize migration:create # Generates a new migration file. $ sequelize version # Prints the version number.

The DataTypes object stores the available data types such as STRING or INTEGER . The third parameter is a callback function which needs to be called once everything was executed. The first parameter of the callback function can be used to pass a possible error. In that case, the migration will be marked as failed. Here is some code: module.exports = { up: function(migration, DataTypes, done) { migration.dropAllTables().complete(done) // equals: migration.dropAllTables().complete(function(err) { if (err) { done(err) } else { done(null) } }) } } The available methods of the migration object are the following. Functions Using the migration object describe before, you will have access to most of already introduced functions. Furthermore there are some other methods, which are designed to actually change the database schema. createTable(tableName, attributes, options) This method allows creation of new tables. It is allowed to pass simple or complex attribute definitions. You can define the encoding of the table and the table's engine via options migration.createTable( 'nameOfTheNewTable', { id: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER, primaryKey: true, autoIncrement: true }, createdAt: { type: DataTypes.DATE }, updatedAt: { type: DataTypes.DATE }, attr1: DataTypes.STRING, attr2: DataTypes.INTEGER, attr3: { type: DataTypes.BOOLEAN, defaultValue: false, allowNull: false } }, { engine: 'MYISAM', // default: 'InnoDB' charset: 'latin1' // default: null } ) dropTable(tableName) This method allows deletion of an existing table. migration.dropTable('nameOfTheExistingTable') dropAllTables() This method allows deletion of all existing tables in the database. migration.dropAllTables() renameTable(before, after) This method allows renaming of an existing table. migration.renameTable('Person', 'User') showAllTables() This method returns the name of all existing tables in the database. migration.showAllTables().success(function(tableNames) {}) describeTable(tableName) This method returns an array of hashes containing information about all attributes in the table. migration.describeTable('Person').success(function(attributes) { /* attributes will be something like: { name: { type: 'VARCHAR(255)', // this will be 'CHARACTER VARYING' for pg! allowNull: true, defaultValue: null }, isBetaMember: { type: 'TINYINT(1)', // this will be 'BOOLEAN' for pg! allowNull: false, defaultValue: false } } */ }) addColumn(tableName, attributeName, dataTypeOrOptions) This method allows adding columns to an existing table. The data type can be simple or complex. migration.addColumn( 'nameOfAnExistingTable', 'nameOfTheNewAttribute', DataTypes.STRING ) // or migration.addColumn( 'nameOfAnExistingTable', 'nameOfTheNewAttribute', { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false } ) removeColumn(tableName, attributeName) This method allows deletion of a specific column of an existing table. migration.removeColumn('Person', 'signature') changeColumn(tableName, attributeName, dataTypeOrOptions) This method changes the meta data of an attribute. It is possible to change the default value, allowance of null or the data type. Please make sure, that you are completely describing the new data type. Missing information are expected to be defaults. migration.changeColumn( 'nameOfAnExistingTable', 'nameOfAnExistingAttribute', DataTypes.STRING ) // or migration.changeColumn( 'nameOfAnExistingTable', 'nameOfAnExistingAttribute', { type: DataTypes.FLOAT, allowNull: false, default: 0.0 } ) renameColumn(tableName, attrNameBefore, attrNameAfter) This methods allows renaming attributes. migration.renameColumn('Person', 'signature', 'sig') addIndex(tableName, attributes, options) This methods creates indexes for specific attributes of a table. The index name will be automatically generated if it is not passed via in the options (see below). // This example will create the index person_firstname_lastname migration.addIndex('Person', ['firstname', 'lastname']) // This example will create a unique index with the name SuperDuperIndex using the optional 'options' field. // Possible options: // - indicesType: UNIQUE|FULLTEXT|SPATIAL // - indexName: The name of the index. Default is __ // - parser: For FULLTEXT columns set your parser // - indexType: Set a type for the index, e.g. BTREE. See the documentation of the used dialect migration.addIndex( 'Person', ['firstname', 'lastname'], { indexName: 'SuperDuperIndex', indicesType: 'UNIQUE' } ) removeIndex(tableName, indexNameOrAttributes) This method deletes an existing index of a table. migration.removeIndex('Person', 'SuperDuperIndex') // or migration.removeIndex('Person', ['firstname', 'lastname']) Programmatic use If you need to interact with the migrator within your code, you can easily achieve that via sequelize.getMigrator . You can specify the path to your migrations as well as a pattern which represents the files that contain the migrations. var migrator = sequelize.getMigrator({ path: process.cwd() + '/database/migrations', filesFilter: /\\.coffee$/ }) Once you have a migrator object, you can run its migration with migrator.migrate .

Sequelize will then automatically add the attributes createdAt and updatedAt to it. So you will be able to know when the database entry went into the db and when it was updated the last time. If you do not want timestamps on your models, only want some timestamps, or you are working with an existing database where the columns are named something else, jump straight on to configuration to see how to do that. var Project = sequelize.define('Project', { title: Sequelize.STRING, description: Sequelize.TEXT }) var Task = sequelize.define('Task', { title: Sequelize.STRING, description: Sequelize.TEXT, deadline: Sequelize.DATE }) You can also set some options on each column: var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { // instantiating will automatically set the flag to true if not set flag: { type: Sequelize.BOOLEAN, allowNull: false, defaultValue: true}, // default values for dates => current time myDate: { type: Sequelize.DATE, defaultValue: Sequelize.NOW }, // setting allowNull to false will add NOT NULL to the column, which means an error will be // thrown from the DB when the query is executed if the column is null. If you want to check that a value // is not null before querying the DB, look at the validations section below. title: { type: Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false}, // Creating two objects with the same value will throw an error. The unique property can be either a // boolean, or a string. If you provide the same string for multiple columns, they will form a // composite unique key. someUnique: {type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: true}, uniqueOne: { type: Sequelize.STRING, unique: 'compositeIndex'}, uniqueTwo: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, unique: 'compositeIndex'} // Go on reading for further information about primary keys identifier: { type: Sequelize.STRING, primaryKey: true}, // autoIncrement can be used to create auto_incrementing integer columns incrementMe: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, autoIncrement: true }, // Comments can be specified for each field for MySQL and PG hasComment: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, comment: \"I'm a comment!\" }, // You can specify a custom field name via the \"field\" attribute: fieldWithUnderscores: { type: Sequelize.STRING, field: \"field_with_underscores\" } }) The comment option can also be used on a table, see model configuration Data types Sequelize currently supports the following datatypes: Sequelize.STRING // VARCHAR(255) Sequelize.STRING(1234) // VARCHAR(1234) Sequelize.STRING.BINARY // VARCHAR BINARY Sequelize.TEXT // TEXT Sequelize.INTEGER // INTEGER Sequelize.BIGINT // BIGINT Sequelize.BIGINT(11) // BIGINT(11) Sequelize.FLOAT // FLOAT Sequelize.FLOAT(11) // FLOAT(11) Sequelize.FLOAT(11, 12) // FLOAT(11,12) Sequelize.DECIMAL // DECIMAL Sequelize.DECIMAL(10, 2) // DECIMAL(10,2) Sequelize.DATE // DATETIME for mysql / sqlite, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for postgres Sequelize.BOOLEAN // TINYINT(1) Sequelize.ENUM('value 1', 'value 2') // An ENUM with allowed values 'value 1' and 'value 2' Sequelize.ARRAY(Sequelize.TEXT) // Defines an array. PostgreSQL only. Sequelize.BLOB // BLOB (bytea for PostgreSQL) Sequelize.BLOB('tiny') // TINYBLOB (bytea for PostgreSQL. Other options are medium and long) Sequelize.UUID // UUID datatype for PostgreSQL and SQLite, CHAR(36) BINARY for MySQL (use defaultValue: Sequelize.UUIDV1 or Sequelize.UUIDV4 to make sequelize generate the ids automatically) The BLOB data type allows you to insert data both as strings and as buffers. When you do a find or findAll on a model which has a BLOB column, that data will always be returned as a buffer. If you are working with the PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE and you need to parse it to a different timezone, please use the pg library's own parser: require('pg').types.setTypeParser(1114, function(stringValue) { return new Date(stringValue + \"+0000\"); // e.g., UTC offset. Use any offset that you would like. }); In addition to the type mentioned above, integer, bigint and float also support unsigned and zerofill properties, which can be combined in any order: Sequelize.INTEGER.UNSIGNED // INTEGER UNSIGNED Sequelize.INTEGER(11).UNSIGNED // INTEGER(11) UNSIGNED Sequelize.INTEGER(11).ZEROFILL // INTEGER(11) ZEROFILL Sequelize.INTEGER(11).ZEROFILL.UNSIGNED // INTEGER(11) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL Sequelize.INTEGER(11).UNSIGNED.ZEROFILL // INTEGER(11) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL The examples above only show integer, but the same can be done with bigint and float Usage in object notation: // for enums: sequelize.define('model', { states: { type: Sequelize.ENUM, values: ['active', 'pending', 'deleted'] } }) Getters & setters It is possible to define 'object-property' getters and setter functions on your models, these can be used both for 'protecting' properties that map to database fields and for defining 'pseudo' properties. Getters and Setters can be defined in 2 ways (you can mix and match these 2 approaches!): as part of a single property definition as part of a model options N.B.: If a getter or setter is defined in both places then the function found in the relevant property definition will always take precedence. Defining as part of a property var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { name: { Sequelize.STRING }, title: { type : Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false, get : function() { /* do your magic here and return something! 'this' allows you to access attributes of the model. example: this.getDataValue('name') works */ }, set : function(v) { /* do your magic with the input here! */ } } }); Defining as part of the model options Below is an example of defining the getters and setters in the model options, notice the title_slugslug getter, it shows how you can define pseudo properties on your models! (the slugify() function was taken from the Underscore.String module , it is slightly modified here so that the example remains self-contained), note that the this.title reference in the title_slug getter function will trigger a call to the title getter function. if you do not want that then use the getDataValue() method ( see below ). var defaultToWhiteSpace = function(characters) { if (characters == null) return '\\\\s'; else if (characters.source) return characters.source; else return ; }; var slugify = function(str) { var from = \"\u0105\u00e0\u00e1\u00e4\u00e2\u00e3\u00e5\u00e6\u0107\u0119\u00e8\u00e9\u00eb\u00ea\u00ec\u00ed\u00ef\u00ee\u0142\u0144\u00f2\u00f3\u00f6\u00f4\u00f5\u00f8\u015b\u00f9\u00fa\u00fc\u00fb\u00f1\u00e7\u017c\u017a\", to = \"aaaaaaaaceeeeeiiiilnoooooosuuuunczz\", regex = new RegExp('[' + from.replace(/([.*+?^=!:${}()|[\\]\\/\\\\])/g, '\\\\$1') + ']', 'g'); if (str == null) return ''; str = String(str).toLowerCase().replace(regex, function(c) { return to.charAt(from.indexOf(c)) || '-'; }); return str.replace(/[^\\w\\s-]/g, '').replace(/([A-Z])/g, '-$1').replace(/[-_\\s]+/g, '-').toLowerCase(); } var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { title: { type : Sequelize.STRING, allowNull: false, } }, { getterMethods : { title : function() { /* do your magic here and return something! */ }, title_slug : function() { return slugify(this.title); } }, setterMethods : { title : function(v) { /* do your magic with the input here! */ }, } }); Helper functions for use inside getter/setter definitions retrieving an underlying property value? always use this.getDataValu() , e.g: /* a getter for 'title' property */ function() { return this.getDataValue('title'); } setting an underlying property value? always use this.setDataValue() , e.g.: /* a setter for 'title' property */ function(title) { return this.setDataValue('title', title.toString().toLowerCase()); } N.B.: It is important to stick to using the setDataValue() and getDataValue() functions (as opposed to accessing the underlying \"data values\" property directly) - doing so protects your custom getters and setters from changes in the underlying model implementations (i.e. how and where data values are stored in your model instances) Setter methods and Object Initialization !!!TODO: write about how setters affect object initialization (both creating new objects with Model.build and retrieving existing objects from storage) !!!!! Validations Model validations, allow you to specify format/content/inheritance validations for each attribute of the model. You can perform the validation by calling the validate() method on an instance before saving. The validations are implemented by validator . Note: In v1.7.0 validations will now be called when executing the build() or create() functions. var ValidateMe = sequelize.define('Foo', { foo: { type: Sequelize.STRING, validate: { is: [\"^[a-z]+$\",'i'], // will only allow letters is: /^[a-z]+$/i, // same as the previous example using real RegExp not: [\"[a-z]\",'i'], // will not allow letters isEmail: true, // checks for email format (foo@bar.com) isUrl: true, // checks for url format (http://foo.com) isIP: true, // checks for IPv4 (129.89.23.1) or IPv6 format isIPv4: true, // checks for IPv4 (129.89.23.1) isIPv6: true, // checks for IPv6 format isAlpha: true, // will only allow letters isAlphanumeric: true // will only allow alphanumeric characters, so \"_abc\" will fail isNumeric: true // will only allow numbers isInt: true, // checks for valid integers isFloat: true, // checks for valid floating point numbers isDecimal: true, // checks for any numbers isLowercase: true, // checks for lowercase isUppercase: true, // checks for uppercase notNull: true, // won't allow null isNull: true, // only allows null notEmpty: true, // don't allow empty strings equals: 'specific value', // only allow a specific value contains: 'foo', // force specific substrings notIn: [['foo', 'bar']], // check the value is not one of these isIn: [['foo', 'bar']], // check the value is one of these notContains: 'bar', // don't allow specific substrings len: [2,10], // only allow values with length between 2 and 10 isUUID: 4, // only allow uuids isDate: true, // only allow date strings isAfter: \"2011-11-05\", // only allow date strings after a specific date isBefore: \"2011-11-05\", // only allow date strings before a specific date max: 23, // only allow values min: 23, // only allow values >= 23 isArray: true, // only allow arrays isCreditCard: true, // check for valid credit card numbers // custom validations are also possible: isEven: function(value) { if(parseInt(value) % 2 != 0) { throw new Error('Only even values are allowed!') // we also are in the model's context here, so this.otherField // would get the value of otherField if it existed } } } } }) Note that where multiple arguments need to be passed to the built-in validation functions, the arguments to be passed must be in an array. But if a single array argument is to be passed, for instance an array of acceptable strings for isIn , this will be interpreted as multiple string arguments instead of one array argument. To work around this pass a single-length array of arguments, such as [['one', 'two']] as shown above. To use a custom error message instead of that provided by node-validator, use an object instead of the plain value or array of arguments, for example a validator which needs no argument can be given a custom message with isInt: { msg: \"Must be an integer number of pennies\" } or if arguments need to also be passed add an args property: isIn: { args: [['en', 'zh']], msg: \"Must be English or Chinese\" } When using custom validator functions the error message will be whatever message the thrown Error object holds. See the node-validator project for more details on the built in validation methods. Hint: You can also define a custom function for the logging part. Just pass a function. The first parameter will be the string that is logged. Validators and allowNull Since v1.7.0 if a particular field of a model is set to allow null (with allowNull: true ) and that value has been set to null , its validators do not run. This means you can, for instance, have a string field which validates its length to be at least 5 characters, but which also allows null . Model validations Since v1.7.0 , validations can also be defined to check the model after the field-specific validators. Using this you could, for example, ensure either neither of latitude and longitude are set or both, and fail if one but not the other is set. Model validator methods are called with the model object's context and are deemed to fail if they throw an error, otherwise pass. This is just the same as with custom field-specific validators. Any error messages collected are put in the validation result object alongside the field validation errors, with keys named after the failed validation method's key in the validate option object. Even though there can only be one error message for each model validation method at any one time, it is presented as a single string error in an array, to maximize consistency with the field errors. (Note that the structure of validate() 's output is scheduled to change in v2.0 to avoid this awkward situation. In the mean time, an error is issued if a field exists with the same name as a custom model validation.) An example: var Pub = Sequelize.define('Pub', { name: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, address: { type: Sequelize.STRING }, latitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -90, max: 90 } }, longitude: { type: Sequelize.INTEGER, allowNull: true, defaultValue: null, validate: { min: -180, max: 180 } }, }, { validate: { bothCoordsOrNone: function() { if ((this.latitude === null) === (this.longitude === null)) { throw new Error('Require either both latitude and longitude or neither') } } } }) In this simple case an object fails validation if either latitude or longitude is given, but not both. If we try to build one with an out-of-range latitude and nolongitude, raging_bullock_arms.validate() might return { 'latitude': ['Invalid number: latitude'], 'bothCoordsOrNone': ['Require either both latitude and longitude or neither'] } Configuration You can also influence the way Sequelize handles your column names: var Bar = sequelize.define('Bar', { /* bla */ }, { // don't add the timestamp attributes (updatedAt, createdAt) timestamps: false, // don't delete database entries but set the newly added attribute deletedAt // to the current date (when deletion was done). paranoid will only work if // timestamps are enabled paranoid: true, // don't use camelcase for automatically added attributes but underscore style // so updatedAt will be updated_at underscored: true, // disable the modification of tablenames; By default, sequelize will automatically // transform all passed model names (first parameter of define) into plural. // if you don't want that, set the following freezeTableName: true, // define the table's name tableName: 'my_very_custom_table_name' }) If you want sequelize to handle timestamps, but only want some of them, or want your timestamps to be called something else, you can override each column individually: var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { /* bla */ }, { // don't forget to enable timestamps! timestamps: true, // I don't want createdAt createdAt: false, // I want updatedAt to actually be called updateTimestamp updatedAt: 'updateTimestamp' // And deletedAt to be called destroyTime (remember to enable paranoid for this to work) deletedAt: 'destroyTime', paranoid: true }) You can also change the database engine, e.g. to MyISAM. InnoDB is the default. var Person = sequelize.define('Person', { /* attributes */ }, { engine: 'MYISAM' }) // or globally var sequelize = new Sequelize(db, user, pw, { define: { engine: 'MYISAM' } }) Finaly you can specify a comment for the table in MySQL and PG var Person = sequelize.define('Person', { /* attributes */ }, { comment: \"I'm a table comment!\" }) Import You can also store your model definitions in a single file using the import method. The returned object is exactly the same as defined in the imported file's function. Since v1:5.0 of Sequelize the import is cached, so you won't run into troubles when calling the import of a file twice or more often. // in your server file - e.g. app.js var Project = sequelize.import(__dirname + \"/path/to/models/project\") // The model definition is done in /path/to/models/project.js // As you might notice, the DataTypes are the very same as explained above module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"Project\", { name: DataTypes.STRING, description: DataTypes.TEXT }) } Since v1.7.0 the import method can now accept a callback as an argument. sequelize.import('Project', function(sequelize, DataTypes) { return sequelize.define(\"Project\", { name: DataTypes.STRING, description: DataTypes.TEXT }) }) Database synchronization When starting a new project you won't have a database structure and using Sequelize you won't need to. Just specify your model structures and let the library do the rest. Currently supported is the creation and deletion of tables: // Create the tables: Project.sync() // will emit success or failure event Task.sync() // will emit success or failure event // Force the creation! Project.sync({force: true}) // this will drop the table first and re-create it afterwards // drop the tables: Project.drop() // will emit success or failure event Task.drop() // will emit success or failure event // event handling: Project.[sync|drop]().success(function() { // ok ... everything is nice! }).error(function(error) { // oooh, did you entered wrong database credentials? }) Because synchronizing and dropping all of your tables might be a lot of lines to write, you can also let Sequelize do the work for you: // create all tables... now! sequelize.sync() // will emit success or failure // force it! sequelize.sync({force: true}) // emit ... nomnomnom // want to drop 'em all? sequelize.drop() // I guess you've got it (emit) // emit handling: sequelize.[sync|drop]().success(function() { // woot woot }).error(function(error) { // whooops }) Expansion of models Sequelize allows you to pass custom methods to a model and it's instances. Just do the following: var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { /* attributes */}, { classMethods: { method1: function(){ return 'smth' } }, instanceMethods: { method2: function() { return 'foo' } } }) // Example: Foo.method1() Foo.build().method2() Of course you can also access the instance's data and generate virtual getters: var User = sequelize.define('User', { firstname: Sequelize.STRING, lastname: Sequelize.STRING }, { instanceMethods: { getFullname: function() { return [this.firstname, this.lastname].join(' ') } } }) // Example: User.build({ firstname: 'foo', lastname: 'bar' }).getFullname() // 'foo bar' You can also set custom methods to all of your models during the instantiation: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // Other options during the initialization could be here define: { classMethods: { method1: function() {}, method2: function() {} }, instanceMethods: { method3: function() {} } } }) // Example: var Foo = sequelize.define('Foo', { /* attributes */}); Foo.method1() Foo.method2() Foo.build().method3() Data retrieval / Finders Finder methods are designed to get data from the database. The returned data isn't just a plain object, but instances of one of the defined classes. Check the next major chapter about instances for further information. But as those things are instances, you can e.g. use the just describe expanded instance methods. So, here is what you can do: find - Search for one specific element in the database // search for known ids Project.find(123).success(function(project) { // project will be an instance of Project and stores the content of the table entry // with id 123. if such an entry is not defined you will get null }) // search for attributes Project.find({ where: {title: 'aProject'} }).success(function(project) { // project will be the first entry of the Projects table with the title 'aProject' || null }) // since v1.3.0: only select some attributes and rename one Project.find({ where: {title: 'aProject'}, attributes: ['id', ['name', 'title']] }).success(function(project) { // project will be the first entry of the Projects table with the title 'aProject' || null // project.title will contain the name of the project }) findOrCreate - Search for a specific element or create it if not available The method findOrCreate can be used to check if a certain element is already existing in the database. If that is the case the method will result in a respective instance. If the element does not yet exist, it will be created. Let's assume we have an empty database with a User model which has a username and a job . User .findOrCreate({ username: 'sdepold' }, { job: 'Technical Lead JavaScript' }) .success(function(user, created) { console.log(user.values) console.log(created) /* { username: 'sdepold', job: 'Technical Lead JavaScript', id: 1, createdAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET), updatedAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET) } created: true */ }) The code created a new instance. So when we already have an instance ... User .create({ username: 'fnord', job: 'omnomnom' }) .success(function() { User .findOrCreate({ username: 'fnord' }, { job: 'something else' }) .success(function(user, created) { console.log(user.values) console.log(created) /* { username: 'fnord', job: 'omnomnom', id: 2, createdAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET), updatedAt: Fri Mar 22 2013 21: 28: 34 GMT + 0100(CET) } created: false */ }) }) ... the existing entry will not be changed. See the job of the second user, and the fact that created was false. Notice that the success callback has two arguments. When using promises you should call spread (API ref) instead of then , since then will only recieve the first argument (the DAO), while spread will recieve both the DAO, and the created boolean. findAndCountAll - Search for multiple elements in the database, returns both data and total count This is a convienience method that combines findAll&lpar;&rpar; and count&lpar;&rpar; (see below), this is useful when dealing with queries related to pagination where you want to retrieve data with a limit and offset but also need to know the total number of records that match the query. The success handler will always receive an object with two properties: count - an integer, total number records (matching the where clause) rows - an array of objects, the records (matching the where clause) within the limit/offset range Project .findAndCountAll({ where: [\"title LIKE 'foo%'\"], offset: 10, limit: 2 }) .success(function(result) { console.log(result.count); console.log(result.rows); }); The options [object] that you pass to findAndCountAll&lpar;&rpar; is the same as for findAll&lpar;&rpar; (described below). findAll - Search for multiple elements in the database // find multiple entries Project.findAll().success(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of all Project instances }) // also possible: Project.all().success(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of all Project instances }) // search for specific attributes - hash usage Project.findAll({ where: { name: 'A Project' } }).success(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Project instances with the specified name }) // search with string replacements Project.findAll({ where: [\"id > ?\", 25] }).success(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Projects having a greater id than 25 }) // search within a specific range Project.findAll({ where: { id: [1,2,3] } }).success(function(projects) { // projects will be an array of Projects having the id 1, 2 or 3 // this is actually doing an IN query }) // or Project.findAll({ where: \"name = 'A Project'\" }).success(function(projects) { // the difference between this and the usage of hashes (objects) is, that string usage // is not sql injection safe. so make sure you know what you are doing! }) // since v1.7.0 we can now improve our where searches Project.findAll({ where: { id: { gt: 6, // id > 6 gte: 6, // id >= 6 lt: 10, // id < 10 lte: 10, // id ne: 20, // id != 20 between: [6, 10], // BETWEEN 6 AND 10 nbetween: [11, 15] // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15 } } }) Complex filtering / OR queries Since v1.7.0-rc3 , it is possible to do complex where queries with multiple levels of nested AND and OR conditions. In order to do that you can use Sequelize.or and Sequelize.and and pass an arbitrary amount of arguments to it. Every argument will get transformed into a proper SQL condition and gets joined with the either AND or OR . Project.find({ where: Sequelize.and( { name: 'a project' }, Sequelize.or( { id: [1,2,3] }, { id: { lt: 10 } } ) ) }) This code will generate the following query: SELECT * FROM `Projects` WHERE ( `Projects`.`name`='a project' AND (`Projects`.`id` IN (1,2,3) OR `Projects`.`id` < 10) ) LIMIT 1 ; Notice, that instead of Sequelize.and you can also use a plain array which will be treated as Sequelize.and if it contains objects or hashes or other complex data types. Furthermore you can use Sequelize.or as value for the where clause. Manipulating the dataset with limit, offset, order and group To get more relevant data, you can use limit, offset, order and grouping: // limit the results of the query Project.findAll({ limit: 10 }) // step over the first 10 elements Project.findAll({ offset: 10 }) // step over the first 10 elements, and take 2 Project.findAll({ offset: 10, limit: 2 }) The syntax for grouping and ordering are equal, so below it is only explained with a single example for group, and the rest for order. Everything you see below can also be done for group Project.findAll({order: 'title DESC'}) // yields ORDER BY title DESC Project.findAll({group: 'name'}) // yields GROUP BY name Notice how in the two examples above, the string provided is inserted verbatim into the query, i.e. column names are not escaped. When you provide a string to order / group, this will always be the case as per v 1.7.0. If you want to escape column names, you should provide an array of arguments, even though you only want to order / group by a single column something.find({ order: [ 'name', // will return `name` 'username DESC', // will return `username DESC` -- i.e. don't do it! ['username', 'DESC'], // will return `username` DESC sequelize.fn('max', sequelize.col('age')), // will return max(`age`) [sequelize.fn('max', sequelize.col('age')), 'DESC'], // will return max(`age`) DESC [sequelize.fn('otherfunction', sequelize.col('col1'), 12, 'lalala'), 'DESC'], // will return otherfunction(`col1`, 12, 'lalala') DESC [sequelize.fn('otherfunction', sequelize.fn('awesomefunction', sequelize.col('col'))), 'DESC'] // will return otherfunction(awesomefunction(`col`)) DESC, This nesting is potentially infinite! [{ raw: 'otherfunction(awesomefunction(`col`))' }, 'DESC'] // This won't be quoted, but direction will be added ] }) To recap, the elements of the order / group array can be the following: String - will be quoted Array - first element will be qouted, second will be appended verbatim Object - Raw will be added verbatim without quoting Everything else is ignored, and if raw is not set, the query will fail Sequelize.fn and Sequelize.col returns functions and quoted cools Raw queries Sometimes you might be expecting a massive dataset that you just want to display, without manipulation. For each row you select, Sequelize creates a_DAO_, with functions for update, delete, get associations etc. If you have thousands of rows, this might take some time. If you only need the raw data and don't want to update anything, you can do like this to get the raw data. // Are you expecting a masssive dataset from the DB, and don't want to spend the time building DAOs for each entry? // You can pass an extra query option to get the raw data instead: Project.findAll({ where: ... }, { raw: true }) count - Count the occurences of elements in the database There is also a method for counting database objects: Project.count().success(function(c) { console.log(\"There are \" + c + \" projects!\") }) Project.count({ where: [\"id > ?\", 25] }).success(function(c) { console.log(\"There are \" + c + \" projects with an id greater than 25.\") }) max - Get the greatest value of a specific attribute within a specific table And here is a method for getting the max value of an attribute: /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.max('age').success(function(max) { // this will return 40 }) Project.max('age', { where: { age: { lt: 20 } } }).success(function(max) { // will be 10 }) min - Get the least value of a specific attribute within a specific table And here is a method for getting the min value of an attribute: /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.min('age').success(function(min) { // this will return 5 }) Project.min('age', { where: { age: { gt: 5 } } }).success(function(min) { // will be 10 }) sum - Sum the value of specific attributes In order to calculate the sum over a specific column of a table, you can use the sum method. /* Let's assume 3 person objects with an attribute age. The first one is 10 years old, the second one is 5 years old, the third one is 40 years old. */ Project.sum('age').success(function(sum) { // this will return 55 }) Project.sum('age', { where: { age: { gt: 5 } } }).success(function(sum) { // wil be 50 }) Eager loading When you are retrieving data from the database there is a fair chance that you also want to get their associations. This is possible since v1&period;6&period;0 and is called eager loading. The basic idea behind that, is the use of the attribute include when you are calling find or findAll . Lets assume the following setup: var User = sequelize.define('User', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) , Task = sequelize.define('Task', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) , Tool = sequelize.define('Tool', { name: Sequelize.STRING }) Task.belongsTo(User) User.hasMany(Task) User.hasMany(Tool, { as: 'Instruments' }) sequelize.sync().done(function() { // this is where we continue ... }) OK. So, first of all, let's load all tasks with their associated user. Task.findAll({ include: [ User ] }).success(function(tasks) { console.log(JSON.stringify(tasks)) /* [{ \"name\": \"A Task\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"UserId\": 1, \"user\": { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\" } }] */ }) Notice that the accessor of the associated data is the name of the model in camelcase with lowercased first character. Also the accessor is singular as the association is one-to-something. Next thing: Loading of data with many-to-something associations! User.findAll({ include: [ Task ] }).success(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"tasks\": [{ \"name\": \"A Task\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:40.000Z\", \"UserId\": 1 }] }] */ }) Notice that the accessor is plural. This is because the association is many-to-something. If an association is aliased (using the as option), you_must_specify this alias when including the model. Notice how the user's Tool s are aliased as Instruments above. In order to get that right you have to specify the model you want to load, as well as the alias: User.findAll({ include: [{ model: Tool, as: 'Instruments' }] }).success(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"instruments\": [{ \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"UserId\": 1 }] }] */ }) Ordering Eager Loaded Associations In the case of a one-to-many relationship. Company.findAll({ include: [ Division ], order: [ [ Division, 'name' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ Division ], order: [ [ Division, 'name', 'DESC' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' } ], order: [ [ { model: Division, as: 'Div' }, 'name' ] ] }); Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, include: [ Department ] } ], order: [ [ Division, Department, 'name' ] ] }); In the case of many-to-many joins, you are also able to sort by attributes in the through table. Company.findAll({ include: [ { model: Division, include: [ Department ] } ], order: [ [ Division, DepartmentDivision, 'name' ] ] }); Nested eager loading User.findAll({ include: [ {model: Tool, as: 'Instruments', include: [ {model: Teacher, include: [ /* etc */]} ]} ] }).success(function(users) { console.log(JSON.stringify(users)) /* [{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2013-03-20T20:31:45.000Z\", \"instruments\": [{ // 1:M and N:M association \"name\": \"Toothpick\", \"id\": 1, \"createdAt\": null, \"updatedAt\": null, \"UserId\": 1, \"Teacher\": { // 1:1 association \"name\": \"Jimi Hendrix\" } }] }] */ }) Final note: If you include an object which is not associated, Sequelize will throw an error. Tool.findAll({ include: [ User ] }).success(function(tools) { console.log(JSON.stringify(tools)) }) // Error: User is not associated to Tool!","title":"Models"},{"location":"docs/models/#definition","text":"To define mappings between a model and a table, use the define method. Sequelize will then automatically add the attributes createdAt and updatedAt to it. So you will be able to know when the database entry went into the db and when it was updated the last time.

To work around this pass a single-length array of arguments, such as [['one', 'two']] as shown above. To use a custom error message instead of that provided by node-validator, use an object instead of the plain value or array of arguments, for example a validator which needs no argument can be given a custom message with isInt: { msg: \"Must be an integer number of pennies\" } or if arguments need to also be passed add an args property: isIn: { args: [['en', 'zh']], msg: \"Must be English or Chinese\" } When using custom validator functions the error message will be whatever message the thrown Error object holds.

Here they are: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // custom host; default: localhost host: 'my.server.tld', // custom port; default: 3306 port: 12345, // custom protocol // - default: 'tcp' // - added in: v1.5.0 // - postgres only, useful for heroku protocol: null, // disable logging; default: console.log logging: false, // max concurrent database requests; default: 50 maxConcurrentQueries: 100, // the sql dialect of the database // - default is 'mysql' // - currently supported: 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'postgres', 'mariadb' dialect: 'mysql', // you can also pass any dialect options to the underlying dialect library // - default is empty // - currently supported: 'mysql', 'mariadb' dialectOptions: { socketPath: '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock', supportBigNumbers: true, bigNumberStrings: true }, // the storage engine for sqlite // - default ':memory:' storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite', // disable inserting undefined values as NULL // - default: false omitNull: true, // a flag for using a native library or not. // in the case of 'pg' -- set this to true will allow SSL support // - default: false native: true, // Specify options, which are used when sequelize.define is called. // The following example: // define: {timestamps: false} // is basically the same as: // sequelize.define(name, attributes, { timestamps: false }) // so defining the timestamps for each model will be not necessary // Below you can see the possible keys for settings.

Just pass a function. The first parameter will be the string that is logged. Read replication Sequelize supports read replication, i.e. having multiple servers that you can connect to when you want to do a SELECT query. When you do read replication, you specify one or more servers to act as read replicas, and one server to act as the write master, which handles all writes and updates and propagates them to the replicas (note that the actual replication process is not handled by Sequelize, but should be set up in MySql). var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', null, null, { dialect: 'mysql', port: 3306 replication: { read: [ { host: '8.8.8.8', username: 'anotherusernamethanroot', password: 'lolcats!' }, { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } ], write: { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } }, pool: { // If you want to override the options used for the read pool you can do so here maxConnections: 20, maxIdleTime: 30000 }, }) If you have any general settings that apply to all replicas you do not need to provide them for each instance. In the code above, database name and port is propagated to all replicas. The same will happen for user and password, if you leave them out for any of the replicas. Each replica has the following options: host , port , username , password , database Sequelize uses a pool to manage connections to your replicas. The default options are: { maxConnections: 10, minConnections: 0, maxIdleTime: 1000 } If you want to modify these, you can pass pool as an options when instantiating Sequelize, as shown above. Note: Read replication only works for MySQL at the moment! Dialects With the release of Sequelize v1&period;6&period;0 , the library got independent from specific dialects. This means, that you'll have to add the respective connector library to your project yourself. Version 1.7.0 stable has been released in bundles with the connector libraries (sequelize-mysql, sequelize-postgres etc.) but these bundles are not maintained, and will not be released for 2.0.0 upwards. MySQL In order to get Sequelize working nicely together with MySQL, you'll need to install mysql&commat;~2&period;0&period;0-alpha7 or higher. Once that's done you can use it like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // mysql is the default dialect, but you know... // for demo purporses we are defining it nevertheless :) // so: we want mysql! dialect: 'mysql' }) Note: You can pass options directly to dialect library by setting the dialectOptions parameter. See Options for examples (currently only mysql and mariadb are supported). MariaDB For MariaDB compatibility you have to install the package mariasql@0.1.20 , or higher. The configuration needs to look like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { dialect: 'mariadb' }) SQLite For SQLite compatibility you'll need sqlite3&commat;~2&period;1&period;5 . Configure Sequelize like this: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // sqlite! now! dialect: 'sqlite', // the storage engine for sqlite // - default ':memory:' storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite' }) PostgreSQL The library for PostgreSQL is pg&commat;~2&period;0&period;0 . You'll just need to define the dialect: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { // gimme postgres, please! dialect: 'postgres' }) Executing raw SQL queries As there are often use cases in which it is just easier to execute raw / already prepared SQL queries, you can utilize the function sequelize&period;query . Here is how it works: // Arguments for raw queries sequelize.query('your query', [, callee], [, options], [, replacements]) // Quick example sequelize.query(\"SELECT * FROM myTable\").success(function(myTableRows) { console.log(myTableRows) }) // Callee is the model definition. This allows you to easily map a query // to a predefined model for sequelizejs e.g: sequelize .query('SELECT * FROM projects', Projects) .success(function(projects){ // Each record will now be mapped to the project's DAO-Factory. console.log(projects) }) // Options is an object with the following keys: sequelize .query('SELECT 1', null, { // A function (or false) for logging your queries // Will get called for every SQL query that gets send // to the server. logging: console.log, // If plain is true, then sequelize will only return the first // record of the result set. In case of false it will all records. plain: false, // Set this to true if you don't have a model definition for your query. raw: false }) // Note the second argument being null! // Even if we declared a callee here, the raw: true would // supersede and return a raw object. sequelize .query('SELECT * FROM projects', null, { raw: true }) .success(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) Replacements in a query can be done in two different ways, either using named parameters (starting with : ), or unnamed, represented by a ? The syntax used depends on the fourth argument passed to the function: If an array is passed, ? will be replaced in the order that they appear in the array If an object is passed, :key will be replaced with the keys from that object. If the object contains keys not found in the query or vice verca, an exception will be thrown. sequelize .query( 'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = ?', null, { raw: true }, ['active'] ) .success(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) sequelize .query( 'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status = :status ', null, { raw: true }, { status: 'active' } ) .success(function(projects) { console.log(projects) }) One note: If the attribute names of the table contain dots, the resulting objects will be nested: sequelize.query('select 1 as `foo.bar.baz`').success(function(rows) { console.log(JSON.stringify(rows)) /* [{ \"foo\": { \"bar\": { \"baz\": 1 } } }] */ })","title":"Usage"},{"location":"docs/usage/#basic-usage","text":"To get the ball rollin' you first have to create an instance of Sequelize. Use it the following way: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username'[, 'password']) This will save the passed database credentials and provide all further methods. Furthermore you can specify a non-default host/port: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', { host: \"my.server.tld\", port: 12345 }) If you just don't have a password: var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username') // or var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', null) You can also use a connection string: var sequelize = new Sequelize('mysql://user:pass@example.com:9821/dbname', { // Look to the next section for possible options })","title":"Basic usage"},{"location":"docs/usage/#options","text":"Besides the host and the port, Sequelize comes with a whole bunch of options.

When you do read replication, you specify one or more servers to act as read replicas, and one server to act as the write master, which handles all writes and updates and propagates them to the replicas (note that the actual replication process is not handled by Sequelize, but should be set up in MySql). var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', null, null, { dialect: 'mysql', port: 3306 replication: { read: [ { host: '8.8.8.8', username: 'anotherusernamethanroot', password: 'lolcats!' }, { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } ], write: { host: 'localhost', username: 'root', password: null } }, pool: { // If you want to override the options used for the read pool you can do so here maxConnections: 20, maxIdleTime: 30000 }, }) If you have any general settings that apply to all replicas you do not need to provide them for each instance. In the code above, database name and port is propagated to all replicas. The same will happen for user and password, if you leave them out for any of the replicas. Each replica has the following options: host , port , username , password , database Sequelize uses a pool to manage connections to your replicas. The default options are: { maxConnections: 10, minConnections: 0, maxIdleTime: 1000 } If you want to modify these, you can pass pool as an options when instantiating Sequelize, as shown above.
