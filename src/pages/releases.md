# Sequelize Versioning Policy

Sequelize follows semantic versioning (semver) principles. [Learn more about semver here](https://semver.org/).

This page regroups information related to which engines versions are supported by Sequelize

## PostgreSQL Support Table

PostgreSQL requires the use of the [pg][pg] (or [pg-native]) npm package.  
[Read more about this here](/docs/v7/other-topics/dialect-specific-things/#postgresql).

:::note

According to [pg's documentation](https://node-postgres.com/#version-compatibility),
only pg >= 8.2 is compatible with Node 14.  
If you're trying to use Sequelize 6 in Node 14 or newer, use that version of pg.

:::

| Sequelize   | [PostgreSQL][postgres] | [pg]                                         | [pg-native]    |

## SQLite Support Table

Sequelize uses the `sqlite3` npm library.  
[Read more about this here](/docs/v7/other-topics/dialect-specific-things/#sqlite).

:::caution

sqlite3 has not been released since February 2021, and has security vulnerabilities and installation issues on newer platforms.

We recommended using the [@vscode/sqlite3](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-sqlite3) fork 
by replacing the version with `npm:@vscode/sqlite3@5.0.7` like in the example below.

It is supported in both v6 & v7.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sqlite3": "npm:@vscode/sqlite3@5.0.7"
  }
}
```

:::

| Sequelize   | [sqlite3]                                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7 (alpha)   | `npm:@vscode/sqlite3@^5.0.7`                                   |
| 6 (current) | `npm:@vscode/sqlite3@^4.0.12`, or `npm:@vscode/sqlite3@^5.0.7` |

## Snowflake Support Table

Snowflake requires the use of the [snowflake-sdk] npm package.  
[Read more about this here](/docs/v7/other-topics/dialect-specific-things/#snowflake).

:::note

While this dialect is included in Sequelize,
support for Snowflake is limited as it is not handled by the core team.

:::

| Sequelize   | [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/pricing/) | [snowflake-sdk] |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 7 (alpha)   | all                                             | ^1.6.0          |

[^⚠️1]: `pg-native` [hasn't had a release since 2018](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-native).
Sequelize will still test against it, but its reliability is degraded in Node >=17.
