# Sequelize Versioning Policy

Sequelize follows semantic versioning (semver) principles. [Learn more about semver here](https://semver.org/).

This page regroups information related to which engines versions are supported by Sequelize

## PostgreSQL Support Table

PostgreSQL requires the use of the [pg][pg] (or [pg-native]) npm package.  
[Read more about this here](/docs/v7/other-topics/dialect-specific-things/#postgresql).

:::note

According to [pg's documentation](https://node-postgres.com/#version-compatibility),
only pg >= 8.2 is compatible with Node 14.  
If you're trying to use Sequelize 6 in Node 14 or newer, use that version of pg.

:::

| Sequelize   | [PostgreSQL][postgres] | [pg]                                         | [pg-native]    |
